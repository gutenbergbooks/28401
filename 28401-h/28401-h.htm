PREFACE</p>
</div>
<p class="pns"><i>I Cannot find, upon the most impartial
Retrospection of the Argument, any Reason to alter my Sentiments
concerning it; and as it is a Matter of the greatest Importance,
’tis hoped that those who maintain the Doctrines of</i> Election,
&amp;<i>c. will afford it all the Weight and Consideration it
deserves. But, if there be any among them, who will hear no
Reason or Argument whatever, and are</i> sure, only because they
are sure, <i>I Have</i> little <i>or</i> no Hopes <i>to prevail
with them, to give me a fair Hearing, or to think</i> candidly
<i>and</i> impartially <i>about it. But as there are among them,
some, who no doubt will allow the</i> Possibility <i>of their
being in an Error; to all such I address my self, and beseech
them, as much as possible to lay aside Prejudice and Partiality;
wisely considering, that many of their Fore-fathers maintained
some erroneous Doctrines, with as much Zeal, and Integrity, as
they their Descendants now do the Doctrines of</i> Election,
&amp;<i>c. and yet saw Occasion to renounce them
afterwards.</i></p>
<p class="pns"><i>There is Reason to fear, the just Liberty I
have taken with the</i> Doctrines of Election, &amp;<i>c. may, by
some, be deem’d Blasphemy against</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>
<i>himself; but I am far from intending any such thing. These
Doctrines (I think) on the contrary, are</i> in them selves
<i>nothing better than</i> blasphemous, <i>tho’ the Intentions of
some who maintain them, be ever so devout and sincere: And if an
Impeachment of Doctrines, which, instead of preserving</i>
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> Moral Character, <i>robs him of all
that is dear and valuable, or that can render him lovely and
adorable to Man, be accounted</i> Blasphemy, <i>the Ignorance and
Bigotry of those, who judge after that Manner, ought much to be
lamented. It is a melancholy Truth, that where Prejudice, in
favour of false Principles, has had early and frequent Access to
the Mind, it too often shuts the Ear against Reason and Truth;
and ’tis very hard to persuade such People to enter at all, and
much less impartially, into the Merits of an Argument advanced
against them; nor indeed is the Liberty of Thought on</i>
Religious Subjects, duly inculcated <i>in Religious Assemblies:
For, the</i> Teachers of Christianity, <i>tho’ they are seldom
averse to give us the Compliment of a</i> just Liberty of
thinking for ourselves, <i>are but too apt</i> to set the Terrors
of the Lord in array against Unbelievers; <i>tho’ perhaps</i>
their Dissent <i>may sometimes be only the</i> innocent Effect,
<i>of the best Examination they are able to make. And if there be
any thing worthy of Notice, in what I have advanced, I hereby
intreat all, into whose Hands this Treatise may come, not to be
terrified, by any such popular Arts, from making a thorough
Examination for themselves; on the other hand, I am altogether as
willing to set right, in whatever I may have erred, or been
mistaken.</i></p>
<p class="pns"><i>’Tis well known, the 17th Article of our
own</i> National Church, <i>greatly favours the</i> Doctrines
<i>of</i> Election <i>and</i> Reprobation; <i>and it is also
generally believed, that the</i> Better Part <i>of our Clergy
entirely disapprove these Doctrines, and would very readily
assist in expunging them out of their</i> Creed; <i>which would
render their Consciences much easier, than now they are, or can
be, under a Subscription in a Sense so</i> very qualified
<i>and</i> remote <i>from the</i> natural Intent <i>and</i>
Meaning <i>of the</i> Article.</p>
<p class="pns"><i>Experience makes it evident, that Education is
able to retain Men of the</i> Brightest Understanding, <i>in the
Belief of the</i> Greatest Absurdities. <i>But, that Men of
Learning, Ingenuity and Experience, who have lived perhaps to the
Age of fifty, in the Disbelief of the</i> Doctrines <i>of</i>
Election, &amp;<i>c. should after that sincerely embrace them, is
to me Matter of great Astonishment; yet this I am inform’d is
really the Case, with regard to one of the most ingenious</i>
Divines, <i>our Metropolis has to boast of. One Reason may
perhaps be alledged, for such an unexpected Alteration of
Sentiment</i>, viz. <i>That tho’ we disbelieve these Doctrines,
because they are</i> absurd, <i>yet we hold at the same time,
others</i>, equally repugnant <i>to Reason, and to Common Sense;
and certainly we may as reasonably</i> embrace <i>the one as</i>
retain <i>the other. Besides, with what reasonable Expectation of
Success could such a Man as this sit down to argue with</i>
another <i>of</i> absurd Principles, <i>when</i> he himself
<i>might be so easily abash’d and put to Silence, by an Appeal
to</i> other Principles, <i>of</i> his own, <i>equally absurd and
inexplicable. The best way then, instead of embracing a</i>
fresh, <i>absurd, Principle of Faith, is, to renounce the</i>
old. <i>I would not willingly Offend</i> A<span class=
"sc">ny</span>, <i>by a special Application to</i> particular
Societies <i>and</i> Doctrines: <i>let but every Man make an
honest Application to himself, and the Articles of Faith he
professes, and the Work of Reformation will, I am persuaded, gain
something thereby. And that, not only these Doctrines, but every
other absurd Principle of Faith, which either Ignorance, or
Design, may have introduced into the Christian church, to the</i>
Dishonour <i>of</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>, <i>the</i>
Burthen <i>and</i> Reproach <i>of Human Nature, may be</i>

<span class="ls1">THOUGHT</span>S, &amp;<i>c</i>.</p>
<p class="pns"><i>CHRISTIANITY</i> having been instituted, by its
great Author and Publisher, for the Benefit and Advantage of
Mankind, it is pity we should so greatly differ, concerning what
<i>Genuine Christianity</i> is; if the <i>Holy Bible</i>, as we
generally agree, was designed to lead us to the true Knowledge of
G<span class="sc">od</span>, and to be a standing and perpetual
Rule of <i>Faith</i> and <i>Manners</i> to Men, it must surely
have been greatly corrupted since the primitive Times of the
Gospel, or the <i>Explication</i> of it designedly left to a more
excellent and superior Director: For the seeming Contradictions,
and Multiplicity of obscure Passages, wherewith it abounds, shew
plainly it could never, in its present Condition, be a Rule of
Faith, &amp;<i>c</i>. becoming an all-wise and perfect Being, to
give to rational Creatures. Every <i>good Man, Society</i>, and
<i>State</i>, study Perspicuity in all their <i>Rules, Orders,
and Statutes,</i> dispensed to their <i>Families, Members,</i>
and <i>Subjects:</i> and can we suppose, that He, who is perfect
in Knowledge, would, in the Dispensation of his Laws, take less
care of the everlasting State of his immortal Creature
<i>Man?</i> Yet it is plain, we differ in our Sentiments of
Religion, and greatly too, for want, as I sincerely hope, of the
Knowledge of better Helps, to direct our Inquiries, in Matters,
the true Knowledge whereof, is of so considerable Moment.
Therefore,</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">intend</span>, in the Course of
this Debate, to descant <i>freely</i>, on the Doctrines of
<i>Divine Sovereignty, Election, Reprobation</i>, and <i>Original
Sin;</i> and also, on the Arguments which some ingenious
Gentlemen have used to support them. But I hope (with regard to
the <i>Authors</i> I may possibly name) to be perfectly decent,
and to treat them with all becoming Respect and Deference, as I
think Men of Integrity, Learning and Abilities deserve; who,
though in some Points they may err, and hold Doctrines in their
own Nature and Tendency altogether subversive of Religion and
Morality, do nevertheless not perceive them to have these
Tendencies, and are therefore by <i>no Means</i> chargeable with
them. Yet, as touching the <i>Doctrines</i> themselves, I shall
presume to speak freely, both in regard to their Nature, and what
appears to me to be their genuine Fruits and Effects.</p>
<p class="pn">I<span class="sc">t</span> is with me an
establish’d Truth, that the mistaken Notion of some <i>learned
Men</i>, concerning the <i>Sovereignty</i> of the <i>Deity</i>,
has given these Doctrines a more favourable Acceptance in the
World, than otherwise they would, or could, ever have met with;
and notwithstanding all the Pains and Arguments these Gentlemen
have bestowed, to reconcile their Doctrines to our common Sense
of <i>Right</i> and <i>Wrong</i>, it is plain, that, at
<i>bottom</i>, this is the grand governing Principle. For, when
their Attempts to reconcile these Doctrines with common Sense and
Equity fail, they have immediate Recourse to G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> <i>Sovereignty</i>, and even go so far, at least
in Effect, as to deny there is <i>any</i> intrinsick Difference
in Things themselves, as shall be made appear from their most
approved Writers, whenever they are pleased to demand it: But as
this Principle of <i>Sovereignty</i> is most certainly their
strong Hold, I shall therefore endeavour to go to the Depth of
this Argument; and shew, in the first Place, how greatly they
misapprehend the Nature of this <i>Attribute;</i> and, in the
second Place, granting it to be as they say, I shall then shew
the <i>precarious</i> and <i>miserable</i> Condition of all
Mankind, not excepting the Elect themselves, under the Government
of such an arbitrary Being.</p>
<p class="pns">To begin with the first. That G<span class=
"sc">od</span> is a <i>Sovereign</i>, we readily allow: But it
will not therefore follow, he is <i>morally capable</i> of doing
any thing, in its <i>own Nature</i>, immoral or unjust. All
religious Debates are allowed to be best determinable by the
divine Attributes; and yet nothing is more common, than to single
out, and lay the greatest Stress on, that Attribute alone, which
appears best to suit our own particular Opinions: which, however
innocent our Intention may be, is, I think, in itself, a very
erroneous and unwarrantable Procedure; for as G<span class=
"sc">od</span> is <i>all-wise</i> and <i>good</i>, as well as
<i>almighty</i> and <i>independent</i>, it is, in the Nature of
Things, impossible (and therefore we should never admit it
possible) he should be capable (in a moral Sense, I mean) of
exerting any one particular Attribute in <i>Opposition</i> to, or
<i>Diminution</i> from, another. A <i>Sovereign</i> he is, nor
can any Creature whatever dispute his <i>unlimited</i> and
<i>uncontroulable</i> Power over his <i>whole Creation</i>. But
Power alone, without Wisdom and Goodness to make a right Use and
Application of it, may be perfect <i>Frenzy</i>, and run into the
greatest Latitude of <i>Folly</i> and <i>Tyranny</i>. It is, if I
may be allowed the Comparison, like a <i>Vessel</i> that has lost
its Helm, continually exposed to the tossing of Winds and Waves.
To talk, therefore, of <i>mere Sovereign Pleasure</i>, without
Regard to the proper Reason or Fitness of Things, so far
operating and bring in the <i>Divine Mind</i> (and which is
nothing more than the Presence and Operation of his own Wisdom)
in order to prefer what, in its own Nature, is <i>best</i>, and
<i>fittest</i> to be done, is excluding from the Deity, those
<i>more</i> blessed and <i>valuable Perfections</i> of
<i>Wisdom</i> and <i>Goodness</i>, and establishing in their
room, and at their Expence, mere Sovereign Power alone.
<i>Physically speaking</i> indeed, we allow G<span class=
"sc">od</span> can do Evil itself; but the moral Perfections of
his Nature, are to us an <i>infallible</i> and <i>unshaken
Security</i>, that he <i>never will</i> do it. <i>Man</i> being
an impotent and fallible Creature, liable, not only to mistake
the true Nature and importance of Things, but when he does
understand his Duty rightly, liable also, thro’ the Prevalence of
<i>Habit</i> and <i>Passion</i>, to be very backward and
defective in performing it, must necessarily be subject to such
Laws, as contain in them Rewards and Punishments, proper to
influence his <i>Hopes</i> and his <i>Fears</i>.</p>
<p class="pns">But as G<span class="sc">od</span>, on the
contrary, is a Being of all possible and infinite Perfections; an
exact Knowledge of what we call <i>Right</i> and <i>Wrong</i>,
<i>Just</i> and <i>Unjust</i>, ever hath, and always will exit in
the <i>Divine Mind</i>, and be to him a perfect, constant, and
invariable Rule of Action, in relation to his Creatures. He that
is <i>infinite</i> in Knowledge, cannot but know, at all Times,
and under the most (to us) difficult and perplex’d Circumstances
of Things, what in its <i>own Nature</i> is <i>best</i>, and
<i>fittest</i> to be done; and, being void of all Bias,
Prejudice, and Passion, cannot but approve of what is
<i>right</i> and <i>best;</i> and being likewise <i>Almighty</i>,
no Power can possibly interrupt, or prevent what he determined to
accomplish: So that it is <i>morally impossible</i>, that
G<span class="sc">od</span> should do an evil Thing, These Truths
are so deducible from each other, and in themselves so evident,
to all unbiassed and inquisitive Minds, that one would wonder to
find Men, of Learning and Integrity, give into the contrary
Sentiments; which, in Effect they do, who hold Doctrines
<i>naturally subversive</i> of these fundamental Truths, as all
certainly do, who depart from the moral Good and Fitness of
Things, and resolve all into <i>mere sovereign Pleasure</i>
alone, <i>independent</i> of Wisdom and Goodness; which must ever
be at hand to <i>cooperate</i> with, and govern the Exertion of,
their favourite Attribute, <i>sovereign Power</i> itself; or, if
they do not expressly affirm this, they do by another Method the
very same thing; and that is, by denying, in Effect, the
<i>intrinsick Difference</i> of Good and Evil, which, according
to them, has no Foundation in the <i>Nature</i> and Relations of
Things, but takes its Rise, only, from the mere Will and
Appointment of the <i>Deity</i>. But if all Things are in
themselves equally Good, where is the Use to <i>appoint</i>, or
the Sense of talking about it? Wisdom and Goodness must,
according to this Notion, be idle and unmeaning Sounds, without
Sense or Service. But alas! the natural Consequence of
maintaining Tenets, so repugnant to common Sense, is seldom less
than running into and embracing other Absurdities, in themselves
equally great with what they are brought to defend, And here, as
some of these Gentlemen are exalted, and I hope deservedly, to
the Dignity of Teachers in the <i>Christian Church</i>, they
will, I hope, permit me to ask them a Question or two, which I
should, on almost any other Occasion, blush to ask any rational
Man, <i>viz</i>. If they do not perceive an intrinsic Beauty and
Excellence in Virtue, as opposed to Vice; independent of all
<i>positive</i> or arbitrary Appointment, tho’ of the
<i>Deity</i> itself; and whether, besides the Commands of
G<span class="sc">od</span>, (which to be sure are of high
Importance, and ought ever to be urged with great Strength and
Energy) they do not also <i>press</i> upon their Hearers, the
Practice of Virtue, and endeavour to recommend, and inforce it on
the Mind, from its <i>own</i> native Charms? But to make this
Matter, still, if possible, more evident; let us suppose the
present excellent Order of Things inverted, and that
G<span class="sc">od</span>, of his own mere Pleasure, had given
Mankind quite contrary Laws, and commanded <i>Rebellion, Murder,
Ingratitude</i>, and all Manner of Intemperance and Debauchery,
instead of their <i>opposite virtues;</i> would the same Fitness,
Beauty, and Propriety, appear to these Gentlemen, as there now
does, in <i>Virtue?</i> If not, from whence the Difference
arises, let them answer.</p>
<p class="pns">As G<span class="sc">od</span> is an infinite Mind
or Spirit, perfectly acquainted, at every Instant of Time, with
whatever <i>hath been, is</i>, or <i>shall be;</i> and all Things
<i>possible to be;</i> ’tis evident, that all possible Relations
of Persons and Things are fully known to him; and that all
<i>moral</i> and <i>divine</i> Obligations, arising from the
Relation we stand in to G<span class="sc">od</span>, and to each
other, did, in their own Nature, <i>previous</i> to actual Law or
Commandment, exist; because the one was in Time, and the other
Eternal; one commenced only (at best) with the <i>Being</i> and
<i>Beginning</i> of Creatures, the other was from all Eternity,
<i>co-existent</i> with the <i>Divine Wisdom</i> itself; and such
an inseparable Concomitant therewith, that, in regard to the
<i>Divine Being</i>, himself, it was absolutely impossible, but
that, on his creating such a Rank of Beings as we are,
<i>moral</i> and <i>religious</i> Obligations must have been
<i>invariably</i> and <i>unalterably</i> the same; and if, as
these Men teach, G<span class="sc">od’s</span> having commanded
the Practice of Virtue, be its peculiar Sanction, and that
<i>alone</i> which distinguishes it from Vice or Evil; then, by
the same or as good an Argument, his commanding Light in the
Beginning, is all the Reason we have for esteeming Light and
Darkness different, (as they really are) the one being the actual
Pretence of a real Body, and the other a mere Name, to signify
its Absence; not that Vice is therefore a mere Name, to signify
the Absence of Virtue, for Comparisons seldom hold good in
<i>every</i> minute Particular; but there is a Parity between the
two Cases, sufficient to justify my bringing in the one, as an
Illustration of the other. There is no Knowledge <i>more
certain</i>, than what Mankind commonly have of Good and Evil;
and he who, in order to serve any private Scheme of Religion,
goes about to depreciate this Knowledge, robs Mankind of all
Truth and Certainty whatever, and in the End subjects his own
darling Schemes to the same Uncertainty; for if we cannot judge
of the Fitness, of plain moral Truth and Duty, neither can we of
any Scheme of Religion; especially such as hang together more by
Art and human Contrivance, than by Reason or Revelation.</p>
<p class="pns">B<span class="sc">eing</span> very desirous to get
all the Information I could, concerning the Matter in Debate; I
have attentively read over Mr. <i>Cole’s</i> Treatise on the
<i>Sovereignty</i> of G<span class="sc">od</span>. I know ’tis
thought an unanswerable Performance; and, so far as it regards
general Christianity, it is worth every Christian’s serious
Notice: But as to the Doctrine it was wrote to support, it leaves
it (in my Judgment) no better than it found it; but is miserably
weak, and defective, as to any Thing that looks like sound
Reason, or true Argument; and amounts to no more than this
<i>poor Assertion, That because G<span class="sc">od</span> is a
Sovereign, he may do what he pleases:</i> And, from the Instances
he brings from Scripture, ’tis plain, that Mr. <i>Cole</i>
himself pays as <i>little</i> Regard to the intrinsick Worth and
Excellence of Things, as is done by many of his Brethren. The
manner in which he has been pleased to give us the Story of
<i>Jacob</i> and <i>Esau</i>, proves the Truth of this
Observation, I have no great Inclination to spend Time in
explaining <i>hard Passages</i> of Scripture, (tho’ if any thing
of that kind can be serviceable, or deem’d excellent, ’tis Mr.
<i>Taylor</i> of <i>Norwich</i> his Book on <i>Original Sin</i>,)
or to trespass on the Reader’s Patience, by throwing one Text of
<i>hard</i> and <i>uncertain</i> Meaning against another; for by
this means the Controversy hath been needlessly prolonged. Where
the Scriptures are <i>plain</i>, <i>positive</i> and
<i>reasonable</i>, their Authority ought to be conscientiously
adhered to: But as this is not always the Case, the <i>next</i>
Thing to knowing what is the <i>true Meaning</i> of any
particular Text of Scripture is, to know what it neither
<i>does</i> nor <i>can</i> possibly mean; in which Case, the
Divine Attributes, and the Nature and Reason, or (if you please)
Fitness of Things, is the best Rule. We <i>cannot</i>, it is
impossible we <i>should</i>, understand the certain determinate
Meaning of any Text of Scripture <i>better</i>, if altogether
<i>so well</i>, as we do <i>know</i> certainly, that
G<span class="sc">od</span> is <i>just</i> and <i>good</i>, and
<i>know</i> also as clearly, what <i>Justice</i> and
<i>Goodness</i> mean, when applied to the <i>Deity</i>, as we do,
when we apply them to <i>ourselves</i>. And this Rule, if duly
observed, would be abundantly sufficient, to set aside many
Interpretations of Scripture, too commonly admitted upon this and
the like Occasions. And, besides this never failing Argument (to
all who attend duly to its Force) it is worth while, just to
remark, that though, as the <i>Bible</i> now stands, there are in
it (as we must acknowledge) some Passages, which (especially at
first sight) seem to favour the Doctrine of <i>Sovereignty</i>,
&amp;c. yet as it is possible, nay sometimes easy, to give them
<i>another interpretation</i>, and the general Scope and Tenor of
the Scripture being agreeable to such an Interpretation, we have
abundantly more Reason to <i>reject</i>, than to <i>admit</i> of
the Sense, in which these Gentlemen are pleased to understand and
expound many Texts of the <i>Bible</i>, relating to this and
other affinitive Points.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">would</span> not, as I observed
before, presume to impose on the Reader’s Time and Patience, by
entering unnecessarily into the scriptural Part of the Argument;
yet I must beg Leave, to make now and then an Observation or two
as I go along: And the first Thing that falls in my way is, the
Story of <i>Jacob</i> and <i>Esau</i>, and the Account which Mr.
<i>Cole</i> gives of it. He not only relates the Story, but
assures us, that <i>Jacob’s</i> obtaining the Blessing was of
Divine Appointment, and (what is more extraordinary) that the
<i>Falsehood</i> and <i>Fraud</i> he practised to accomplish it,
was all of G<span class="sc">od’s</span> own immediate Direction;
and this he gives as an Instance of G<span class="sc">od’s</span>
<i>Sovereignty</i>, and proceeding contrary to the moral Fitness
of Things, and the Nature of those Laws he hath given to Man.
That G<span class="sc">od</span> intended <i>Jacob</i> the
<i>Blessing</i>, or preferred him to <i>Esau</i>, I readily
grant; but cannot admit it to be inferred from thence, that the
Means, by which it was, as we reckon, accomplished, were
<i>Divine</i> also: There is a more natural or (at least) more
justifiable way of accounting for the whole Matter. According to
the History, it seems plain, that <i>Rebecca</i> only, and not
her Husband, was privy to this Designation of the <i>Deity:</i>
she had upon Inquiry (when with Child) received such an Assurance
from the L<span class="sc ls2">ord</span>; which might be the
<i>first Cause</i> of her preferring <i>Jacob</i> to <i>Esau</i>,
and which in Time, ’tis probable, grew up into a much greater
Degree of <i>Partiality</i> and <i>Fondness:</i> All this Time
the good Old <i>Patriarch</i>, her Husband, seems to have been
entirely unacquainted with the Affair. And when the Time drew
nigh, in which, according (as some think) to Custom, he was about
to <i>bless</i> his <i>eldest</i> Son, <i>Rebecca</i> then grew
diffident of the Accomplishment of the Promise made in
<i>Jacob’s</i> Behalf, and applied herself to the Means, which
the Text tells us was used on that Occasion. As to the Authority
those Heads of Families had to <i>confer Benefits</i> on their
Offspring, by way of <i>Blessing</i>, though I shall not now much
contend about it, yet give me Leave to make a few Observations.
It don’t appear to me that <i>Isaac</i>, in giving his Blessing,
did so properly or so much bestow it on the <i>Person</i> of
<i>Jacob</i> present, as he did on the <i>Person</i> of
<i>Esau</i> absent; because it is the Intention which ought
principally to be regarded, and <i>Esau</i> undoubtedly was
intended. Again, this way of blessing, if considered in itself as
a mere Tradition, could be <i>no more</i> efficacious, than what
now prevails in some Parts of the <i>Christian Church</i>. All
true Authority of this kind (if any there be) must result from
<i>immediate Inspiration and Command;</i> and whether
<i>Isaac</i> had these Qualifications, while <i>Jacob</i> stood
before him, personating <i>Esau</i>, is a Matter of no small
Doubt and Dispute. He was (’tis evident) much surprised at the
<i>Cheat</i>, put on him by his <i>Wife</i> and <i>Son</i>, and
would doubtless very willingly have given <i>Esau</i> the
Preference, according to his first Intention; but something
<i>supernatural</i> seems now to have seized and satisfied him,
that <i>Jacob</i> was the Person intended; for he cries out, “I
have blessed him, yea and he shall be blessed.” And this latter
Assurance, and the Energy and Satisfaction wherewith the Words
were pronounced, I take <i>rather</i> to have been the <i>true
Blessing</i> than the <i>other</i>. For, as the Reason of
<i>Jacob’s</i> Dissimulation was intirely owing to his Mother’s
Diffidence and Impatience; so, there is no Doubt to be made, but
that the <i>Almighty</i> himself would, had she not interfered,
have brought it about in a manner becoming his <i>Holiness</i>,
and not by <i>Falsehood</i>, <i>Deceit</i>, and
<i>Dissimulation</i>. <i>Religion</i> can never be <i>more</i>
dishonoured, or the Despensations of G<span class="sc">od</span>
to Mankind receive <i>greater</i> Reproach, than when <i>Divine
Purposes</i> are (under G<span class="sc">od’s</span> immediate
Direction) said to be accomplish’d by Methods in themselves
<i>evil</i> and <i>immoral</i>, and altogether opposite to His
Commands. Hath he forbid us Lying, under the <i>Penalty</i> of
<i>Hell-Fire</i>, and shall he himself practise it, or
immediately influence another to do it, for the sake of bringing
to pass some Event, which he could as easily have accomplish’d,
by Methods purely righteous and honourable! And had <i>Jacob</i>
never been prompted, or attempted to obtain the Blessing in the
manner he did attempt it, ’tis more than probable, that
G<span class="sc">od</span>, who removed <i>Isaac’s</i> Surprise,
and caused him to break forth as he did, “I have blessed him, yea
and he shall be blessed,” would never have permitted or impowered
<i>Isaac</i>, to have <i>blessed Esau</i>, in an <i>effectual</i>
manner beyond his Brother: Or if a mere Pronouncing of Words,
when uttered as a Blessing from the Heads of Families, was in
itself an <i>irreversible Blessing</i>, and <i>Isaac</i> had
attempted to bestow it on <i>Esau</i>, G<span class=
"sc">od</span> no doubt would have stayed his Mouth by
<i>Intimations within;</i> as he did, on another Occasion, the
<i>Hand of Abraham</i>, by an Angel without: Provided, I say, it
be allowed, that a <i>formal Blessing</i>, from the Mouth of
<i>Isaac</i>, was necessary to confirm on <i>Jacob</i> those
superior Privileges, which G<span class="sc">od</span> had
designed for him; and that this Interpretation of the Text is
more honourable, and better becoming the Truth and Majesty of the
<i>Divine Being</i>. I appeal not to Reason only, but to Mr.
<i>Cole</i> himself: For whatever Influence Prejudice, or
Enthusiasm, may have on some Minds, there are certain Seasons,
wherein Truth will display itself to the Realm and Understanding
of Mankind, and extort, even from the Mouths of those, who
sometimes oppose her, the most ample Concessions in her Favour.
Take the following as an Instance—<i>Cole’s Sovereignty of
God</i>, Page 41, 2d Edit. “To this also might be added the
strict Injunctions that G<span class="sc">od</span> hath laid upon
the subordinate Dispensers of his Law; as namely, to judge the
People with just Judgment, not to wrest Judgment, nor respect
Persons; yea, he curseth them that pervert Judgment, and will
surely reprove them that accept Persons; and shall mortal Man be
more just than God? will he, under such Penalties, command Men to
do thus, and not do so himself?”</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> Argument is
undoubtedly equally applicable to the Sin of <i>Lying</i>, or
indeed to any Sin whatever; and I appeal to every unprejudiced
Reader, if any Thing more to the Purpose could be urged, against
his own Account of the Affair between <i>Jacob</i> and
<i>Esau</i>, or even against the Doctrine itself, which he writes
his Book to support: and this, in Conjunction with my foregoing
Arguments, may, I hope, be Answer sufficient for the Use they
make of <i>all other</i> parallel Places of Scripture.</p>
<p class="pns">B<span class="sc">y</span> this Concession ’tis
plain, that Justice and Goodness in G<span class="sc">od</span>
are, by this Author, considered the same as in us; how else were
it possible, to understand what the Laws of G<span class=
"sc">od</span> truly mean? <i>Be you perfect, as your Father
which is in Heaven is perfect</i>, is a plain Indication (taking
in the Context) of the moral Perfections of the Divine Nature, in
Part apparent to us, as the Text observes, from his admirable
Bounty in the Creation; <i>He causeth his Sun to rise on the Evil
and on the Good, and sendeth his Rain on the Just and the
Unjust</i>. Though at other Times, when these Gentlemen are hard
pinched with the Iniquity and Injustice of their Doctrines, they
apply for Refuge to the <i>Sovereignty</i> of G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, and give strong Intimations, that <i>Justice</i>
and <i>Goodness</i>, when applied to him, are mere unmeaning
Sounds, which at best signify, what mere Sovereignty pleases to
do, and that when applied to Man, they signify quite another
Thing. And this naturally leads me to the second Thing I proposed
to consider, <i>viz</i>. That allowing the Doctrine of
<i>Election</i> to be, as they say, resolveable into
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> Sovereignty; that G<span class=
"sc">od</span> is just such a Sovereign, as this Doctrine
supposes, and these Gentlemen take him to be; that they have his
Word for their own Election and Salvation; yet even then, there
could be no manner of Certainty as to Religion, no Dependance on
the Promises and Threatnings of the Gospel; and consequently, the
supposed Elect must <i>beat the Air</i>, and run at the same or
as great Uncertainties, as any other Persons whatever, under the
Government of such an arbitrary Being.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">have</span>, to avoid Dispute,
proposed this Argument more to the Advantage of the Elect, than I
was strictly obliged to do, by allowing them to be absolutely
certain, that G<span class="sc">od</span> has told them, that
they are his Elect, and that he will give them eternal Life;
which, allowing the Doctrine of <i>Election</i> to be true, is
generally much more than they can prove, either to themselves, or
to others: allowing, I say, the Doctrine of <i>Election</i> to be
clearly revealed in Scripture, there will be this Difficulty
behind, as to the certain Marks of being of that Number. The
Scripture must also as clearly reveal the Marks, as it does the
Doctrine, or we shall not be able to apply with any Certainty to
ourselves. Is believing the Doctrine, &amp;<i>c</i>. and thinking
myself one of this happy Number, a Rule sufficient to abide by?
If so, no Man who has this Faith, concerning the <i>Doctrine</i>
and <i>himself</i>, can ever depart from it. Yet, there have been
many Instances of Persons, zealous in that way, who saw Occasion
afterwards to renounce the Doctrine itself, and with it that
<i>imaginary</i> and <i>ungrounded Conceit</i> of their being,
for no Reason whatever, G<span class="sc">od’s</span> dear
Children and Favourites, and embraced, in its room, the Doctrines
of <i>universal Grace</i> and <i>Free-will;</i> and upon the best
Reasons too, for as without the one, G<span class="sc">od</span>
cannot be just, so without the other, Man, being no Agent, can be
no Subject of Rewards and Punishments. These very Men were before
thought to be elect, by their most spiritual and best judging
Brethren, who pronounced them chosen in <i>Christ</i>, and
unshaken in the Faith; and so indeed they judged concerning
themselves: But the Grace of G<span class="sc">od</span> being
once permitted freely to operate in the Mind, it soon expelled
that Ignorance, and Narrowness of Spirit, which (even in many
well meaning Persons) is the genuine Effect of such narrow
Doctrines. If having this Faith be no certain Mark, because a Man
may depart from it, what Proof have they? surely none: But
allowing them an absolute Certainty, as to themselves, that
G<span class="sc">od</span> hath told them, in Person, that they
are his Elect, it will (on their own darling Principle of
Sovereignty) amount to just nothing at all; because, as a
Sovereign, G<span class="sc">od</span> may promise one thing, and
intend, nay do another, or the contrary; nor can they prove, or
have they the least Assurance, he will not thus deal with them,
without recurring to other Principles, which will hold equally
strong against the Doctrines themselves—To this Dilemma are these
Gentlemen inevitably reduced; they must either give up the
Doctrines, or part with any Security of Dependance on
G<span class="sc">od</span> himself, as to their own Happiness.
It will be <i>in vain</i>, here, to refer to the <i>Goodness of
God</i>, though, on <i>my</i> Principles, the Argument would be
unanswerable; on <i>theirs</i>, it is <i>stark naught</i>, and
avails nothing. And pray observe the <i>double Dealing</i> this
reduces them to; it is something like setting up <i>two Gods</i>
instead of one, or, which is much the same, ascribing to the
<i>eternal, unchangeable Being</i>, an inconsistent and contrary
Conduct. Here is, <i>first</i>, a <i>mere</i> arbitrary Being,
that decrees, or pretends to decree, by mere <i>Sovereign
Pleasure</i> only, the Salvation of the <i>Elect;</i> but,
because such a Being may as well break his Promise as keep it,
here is <i>another</i> to make <i>good</i> the Promise, who
invariably acts according to the moral Fitness of Things: Or, if
you take it the other way, here is, 1<i>st</i>, A Promise made as
a mere <i>Sovereign</i>, undetermined by, and unregardful of,
<i>all</i> moral Obligations; and, 2<i>dly</i>, The Performance
of this Promise is expected, from a Principle of Justice and
Goodness; ever conformable <i>to</i> the moral Reason and Fitness
of Things: And certainly, in either Case, it leaves Things very
precarious; nor can the Promises of such a Being as this (I speak
it with all possible Reverence to the true G<span class=
"sc">od</span> himself) be any thing near so valuable, or fit to
be depended on, as the Engagements of a good and worthy Man.
<a name="p19" id="p19">And whatever these Gentlemen, to put a
more plausible Out-side on their Doctrines</a>, say, concerning
the Freedom and Excellence of that State, wherein our first
Father <i>Adam</i> was created, and the <i>Possibility</i> of his
having remained perfectly innocent, and the Blessings of eternal
Life, which would have been thence derived to <span class=
"sc">all</span> his Posterity, it is plain to me, they generally
believe no such thing; but that, on the contrary, G<span class=
"sc">od</span> absolutely <i>willed</i> and <i>decreed</i> the
<i>Fall of Adam</i>, Mr. <i>Cole</i> himself, their great
Advocate, is far from supposing the Condition of <i>Adam</i> to
have been proper for abiding long in Obedience to the Divine
Command, or that, had he stood, his Posterity would have thence
become <i>impeccable</i> and <i>happy:</i> on the contrary, he
represents <i>Adam’s</i> Condition as a very weak and imperfect
State, by no mean suited to the Temptations, which his Maker knew
he would shortly be exposed to, and overcome with; and all his
Posterity, <i>had they been tried one by one, would</i>, it
seems, <i>have failed as he did</i>, Page 72. If all this does
not amount to something equal to a positive Assertion, that
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>willed</i> the Fall of Adam, and
in Consequence of it, the Guilt and Desert of eternal Death,
which is said to be thence derived, to <i>all</i> his prosperity,
I do not know what is, or can be equal to it; and indeed all
this, and much more, may easily be resolved into the Doctrine of
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> <i>Sovereignty:</i> and whoever
thinks I have misrepresented their Faith, need only consult their
great apostle Mr. <i>Calvin</i>. But let me further pursue my
Argument, to prove, that tho’ a Man of this <i>Faith</i> has
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> <i>own Word</i> for his Election
and Salvation, he cannot, on this Principle of <i>mere
Sovereignty</i>, reasonably or safely depend on it: My Reason,
which is short and plain, I have already given; because
G<span class="sc">od</span>, as a <i>Sovereign</i>, may do just
what he pleases, <i>keep</i> his Promises, or <i>break</i> them.
There can be no Possibility of evading this Argument, without
coming back to the Goodness of G<span class="sc">od</span>; which
is at once to set aside mere <i>Sovereign</i> Pleasure, and
evidently recurring to the moral Fitness of Things. As much as
these Gentlemen are pleased to despise this moral Fitness, and
superstitiously exalt the mere Will of G<span class=
"sc">od</span> in Opposition thereto; and if the <i>Goodness</i>
of G<span class="sc">od</span> proves, that he <i>cannot</i>
break the Promise he has made to them of eternal Life; it is at
least as strong a Proof to me, that such a good Being <i>could
not</i> possibly make me for eternal Misery, or, which is the
very same Thing, will or decree the Fall of <i>Adam</i>, and pass
the Sentence of eternal Death on all his Posterity; the far
greatest Part of whom he leaves, in this Condition, to perish
everlastingly, and <i>miserable</i> me among the rest!</p>
<p class="pns">A D<span class="sc">ue</span> Survey of the two
Cases, or Conditions, of the Elect and Non-elect, may serve to
set this Matter in a clear Light, G<span class="sc">od</span>
being in himself antecedent to the Existence of all other Beings,
infinitely glorious and happy, could have no Occasion for
Creatures to add to his Blessedness; all that we call
<i>evil</i>, such as Cruelty and Injustice in Man, ever arises
from such a <i>vicious</i> and <i>imperfect</i> State of Mind, as
cannot, for that Reason, possibly belong to <i>Deity</i>. As the
Sources, therefore, whence these Evils arise, cannot be in
G<span class="sc">od</span>; such a Conduct, as these Doctrines
suppose, is also equally impossible to proceed from G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, whose <i>only Intent</i> in creating must be, to
communicate Happiness to his Creatures: Creation infers
Providence, and to bring a sensible rational Being into this
World; and, instead of taking <i>due Care</i> of its Safety and
Happiness, to <i>decree</i> and render it eternally miserable, is
in its <i>own Nature</i>, much worse than making an absolute
Promise of eternal Life to any created being, and
<i>disappointing that Being</i> of its Happiness, whether by
annihilation, or by changing it to another State, or Mode of
Being, no more happy than the present mortal Life; ’tis only a
Breach of Promise, which, in such a <i>Sovereign</i>, is a mere
trifle. We have <i>no natural</i> Right to Immortality,
<i>much</i> less to immortal Happiness; it is the mere Effect of
Divine Bounty—But, being created in a weak, dependent State, and
surrounded with Wants and Infirmities, we <i>have</i> a
<i>natural Right</i> to the Care and Protection of our Maker; and
tho’ we allow, no <i>formal Promise</i> is made on our Behalf,
yet the <i>very act</i> itself, of creating such Beings, and the
Condition we <i>are</i> placed in, contains in it the
<i>Substance</i> of a Promise; and we may be assured,
G<span class="sc">od</span> will have proper Regard to such
Beings. If G<span class="sc">od</span> be gracious enough to
<i>give</i> eternal Life, to which we have not the <i>least</i>
natural Right, can he possibly with-hold that which, from our
Make and Dependance on him, we have just Reason to expect? and
how Much more impossible is it, that he should make us for
everlasting Misery! To make <i>one Man</i> for Damnation, is much
worse, than promising eternal Life to another, and breaking that
Promise; he that does the former, cannot be depended on in the
latter. Methinks, the very Creation itself, and bountiful
Provision therein made, for the Accommodation and Happiness of
Man, might assure us, that (Man being made principally for
another World) a <i>proportionate Care</i> will be taken of his
more important and everlasting Concerns. Which presents me with a
fair Opportunity, of exposing a Notion these Gentlemen hold, or a
Method they have, of interpreting such plain Texts of Scripture,
as are brought to prove G<span class="sc">od’s</span> general
Care and Providence over his whole Creation; in
<i>particular</i>, where <i>David</i> says, “The tender Mercies
of the L<span class="sc ls2">ord</span> are over all his Works:”
This, if you believe them, relates only to this Life; so I think
Mr. <i>Gill</i> says. But what then, Is no Inference thence to be
made? If G<span class="sc">od</span> be thus tender, to provide
Temporals, how <i>much more</i> will he be kind to the Soul, and
provide for <i>that!</i> ’Tis a natural and strong Way of
arguing, and it was our Saviour’s own Method of arguing, as the
most Plain and Conclusive: “Wherefore if G<span class=
"sc">od</span> so cloath the Grass of the Field, &amp;<i>c</i>.
How much more shall he cloath you, &amp;<i>c</i>.” <i>Mat</i>.
vi. 30. The Argument rises in one Case, as much above the other,
as <i>immortal Life</i> is preferable to the present <i>mortal
State;</i> and suppose any of us should sympathise with a near
Friend, under a <i>small Degree</i> of Pain and Affliction, would
not the same Spirit of Friendship and Humanity have a <i>stronger
Sympathy</i>, when Affliction becomes more intense and severe? To
be tender and pitiful in the least and lowest Matters, and
unregardful and cruel in important and everlasting Concerns, is,
with regard to the <i>Divine Being</i>, a moral Impossibility;
’tis <i>beneath</i> human Nature and Prudence, and the Practice
of a good Man; And yet these Doctrines teach this horrible
impiety concerning the great G<span class="sc">od</span>
himself.</p>
<p class="pns">To sum up this Argument: That Being who can make a
sensible rational Creature, on <i>Purpose</i> for
<i>Damnation</i>, instead of taking a reasonable Care of it,
which, from its Make and Dependance, it has a Right to expect, as
much as though a formal Promise were made, may, with altogether
as much (<i>nay more</i>) Justice, break its Promises of eternal
Life, <i>made</i> to another Creature of the same Kind; its Claim
not being founded in Nature, but built on Promise. As the former
would be a more cruel and un-justifiable Proceeding than the
latter, he that is capable of doing the one, can have <i>no moral
Perfections</i> in his Nature sufficient to secure the
<i>Elect</i> against his doing the other: and on this <i>wild</i>
and <i>boundless</i> Principle of <i>Sovereignty</i>, it is
possible that, with regard to <i>Religion</i>, Things may be
quite <i>reversed</i> hereafter; the <i>Elect</i>, as they are
called, made <i>miserable</i>, and the <i>Non-elect, happy</i>. I
think we may challenge the whole World, to shew on this mad
Principle the contrary; and why, as well as any thing else, such
an Economy may not be resolved into <i>Sovereign Pleasure</i>. If
G<span class="sc">od</span> to <i>Isaac</i> conveyed such errant
Falshoods, by the Instrumentality of <i>Jacob’s Mouth</i>, <i>Why
not</i> make the same <i>deceitful Use</i> of the <i>Bible</i>,
or even of his own immediate Word, in regard to the Elect? If
G<span class="sc">od</span>, as Mr. <i>Gill</i> (I think)
observes, has two Wills, “One publick Will of Command, and
another of Intention, which is private;” Why, with regard to the
<i>Elect</i>, may he not promise one thing, and intend, nay
resolve on another? One would think it impossible, for any
understanding Man to judge thus of his Creator, that it is
possible he should command one Thing under the <i>severest
Penalties</i>, and at the <i>same Time</i> not only <i>will</i>
and <i>intend</i>, but irresistibly and secretly work to
accomplish just the contrary, and (what is amazing beyond Belief)
after all punish severely the Creatures concerned, whom he
actuates to bring his secret Purposes to pass: If there can be
such a thing as arbitrary Power and tyrannical Government, in the
very worst Sense of all, here it is. And here certainly is all
the <i>Phrensy</i>, <i>Folly</i>, and <i>Tyranny</i>, which, I
told you in the Beginning, the Government of such an arbitrary
Being (as these Gentlemen represent the Deity to be) must ever be
liable to.</p>
<p class="pns">It is evident, that as worthy Sentiments of
G<span class="sc">od</span> and of Religion, better the Mind, and
improve the Understanding; so do weak and superstitious
Principles corrupt the intellectual Faculty, and render the Soul
more blind and inhuman, than it is in its natural State,
unassisted and unimproved by Divine Grace. I have the rather made
choice of this Argument, not only because I have never seen it
urged before, but because I think it more nearly affects Men of
this Faith, than any I have hitherto met with. I may be mistaken;
but while it has such weight with me, I cannot but earnestly
recommend it to the serious and impartial Consideration of all
who profess this Faith, more especially those who preach it
publickly to the World; whose Acknowledgment of what I take to be
Truth, or friendly Animadversions thereon, will be Matter of no
small Satisfaction to me: But I must here enjoin one Caution,
<i>viz</i>. that it will be a absolutely in vain to produce Texts
of Scripture, till this Point is better settled between us. In
the Art of evading Scripture Proofs, I allow these Gentlemen to
be very skilful and expert; nor can I help believing, that a
small Part of the Penetration and Dexterity, usually exercised on
these Occasions, would, in Men of contrary Principles, or even in
themselves, could they be persuaded to think differently, be
abundantly sufficient to overthrow even the Doctrines themselves:
They have a peculiar Talent, at misunderstanding; and perverting
the plainest Text, and rendering those which are difficult and
obscure in their literal Sense, with much Boldness, and without
Hesitation; they stumble in a plain Path at Noon-Day, and walk
carelessly at Midnight amongst Rock, and upon the most dangerous
Precipices. And here I might safely rest the Argument, and make a
final End of it. <i>Sovereignty</i>, such an one as they contend
for, once proved, any thing whatever may be allowed to follow,
and all Disputations will be utterly in vain. Allow but the
<i>Roman Church</i> its <i>Infallibility</i>, and the Truth of
other Doctrines will unavoidably follow. Till these Gentlemen, I
say, set my main Principles aside, all the Scripture in the World
will be nothing to their Purpose. Not but in the main the
<i>Bible</i> is against them; for the Scriptures <i>reveal</i>
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> Being and Attributes <i>more
clearly</i> than they do most Points of Doctrine: the Reason is,
because the Doctrines commonly embraced, are in themselves <i>not
so plain</i> to Reason, as the Being and Attributes of
G<span class="sc">od</span>; the latter being generally
acknowledged in all Christian Churches, tho’ at the same Time
they widely differ about particular Doctrines, some of which have
no doubt been greatly corrupted in passing through <i>various
Hands</i> and Translations: and I have been informed, by much
better Judges than I pretend to be, that the <i>New
Testament</i>, even in these very Doctrines I have been
contending against, has, by <i>some Partiality</i> or
<i>Neglect</i>, been made to speak more roundly in their Favour,
than the original <i>Greek</i>, or best Copies, will support; and
that, in some Places, the Meaning of the Original is inverted in
the Translation. The Scripture not only revealing to us the
<i>Being</i> and <i>Attributes</i> of G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, <i>more clearly</i> than it does many Doctrines,
and that Fundamental of all true Religion being also in itself
perfectly agreeable to the Light of Nature; ’tis evident, we are
bound to reject the most positive Text of Scripture militating
against this everlasting and fundamental Truth: and rather than
part with this, we had much better suppose the Writer, as to
disputable Points, to have been mistaken at the first, or the
true Meaning corrupted by others. The Translators are allowed to
have been fallible Men, and ’tis very probable some Errors might
creep in at that Door: But it will not so easily be granted, that
the <i>inspired Writers</i> could mistake, nor would I suppose
it, unless in <i>very extraordinary Cases</i>, where either
<i>that</i> or something <i>worse</i> must be supposed; and such
a Supposition will, I am sure; much better become us, than to
imagine it possible for G<span class="sc">od</span> to make a
Revelation of his Will to Man, which shall upon Examination be
found <i>contrary</i> to his Being and Goodness, as well as
expressly contrary to other <i>plain Parts</i> of this
Revelation, Tho’ the Argument, I say, might be safely rested
here, yet as there are some well meaning Persons, who believe
that <i>Adam</i> was made upright, and furnished with a Stock of
Strength and Understanding, sufficient to <i>preserve</i> his
Innocence; that G<span class="sc">od</span> made a Covenant with
him, as our <i>Federal</i> or <i>Representative Head</i>, wherein
it was stipulated, that if he continued upright, during the Time
of Probation allotted, <i>all</i> his Posterity should be <i>for
ever</i> happy; but that if he fell, <i>all</i> should be
<i>subject</i> to everlasting Misery, as the counter Part of the
Covenant; and he falling, the Restoration of his fallen Race
should be intirely owing to the good Pleasure of G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, who might <i>redeem all</i> or only <i>a
Part</i>, and leave the rest to perish in the State wherein he
found them, and in which <i>Adam</i> had involved them by his
Transgression: This they call <i>Preterition</i>, or a <i>Passing
by</i>, which sounds a little better than that harsh Word
<i>Reprobation</i>, tho’ in reality no better at all: And on this
first Transgression <i>some</i> found the Doctrine of
<i>Election</i>, and others that of <i>Infant-Baptism</i>, as an
Expedient to wash away this original Guilt; and it must be owned,
the Virtue of the Remedy is admirably well suited to the
Malignity of the Disease. I shall, for their sakes, inspect a
little farther into the Affair; to me it appears unreasonable,
and therefore improbable, that G<span class="sc">od</span> should
make with <i>Adam</i> any such Covenant or Agreement, or suffer
the eternal State of all Mankind to hang upon the single Thread
of <i>one Man’s</i> Behaviour, and who too (it seems)
G<span class="sc">od</span> knew would swerve from his Obedience:
besides, in all equitable Covenants, <i>every Party</i> concerned
has a Right to be consulted, nor can they be justly included to
their own Detriment, without Consent first obtained, (especially
if the Thing covenanted for, has an immediate, or may have a very
fatal, tho’ very remote, Tendency, to make <i>wretched</i> and
<i>unhappy</i>) which, in this Case, with regard to the Unborn,
could not possibly be had. I am sensible the Gentlemen against
whom I am arguing (especially Mr. <i>Gill</i>) have many pretty
Inventions, to justify such a Conduct in the Divine Being, such
as producing parallel Instances, drawn from the allowed Practice
of Men, and Usage of the State; in particular, the Law relating
to <i>High-Treason</i>, whereby a <i>Rebel’s</i> immediate
Descendants are <i>deprived</i> of inheriting their Father’s
Estate, with others of a like Kind; to all which, what I am about
to offer may, I hope, be a sufficient Answer: The two Cases
differ so widely, that it will be no easy Undertaking to make any
Thing of this Instance in their Favour; and ’tis very surprising,
to find Men of the brightest Intellects, so weak as to argue and
infer, from the Laws of <i>Fallible Men</i>, to the Laws of an
<i>Infallible</i> and <i>Holy Being:</i> The Inference ought
rather to be just the Reverse; for such Institutions as Men, in
this weak and imperfect State, may think convenient for their own
Sakes, and the Good of Society, to establish and ordain, can be
<i>no Rule</i> to him, whose Infinite Wisdom and Almighty Power
set him <i>far above</i> all such Necessity. Nor, again, does
this Case come up to the Matter in Dispute: It is true, that the
Heir of a convict Rebel <i>cannot</i>, according to our Laws,
inherit his Father’s Estate; but what then, does it deprive him
of any thing that was his own before? No; the Law convicts the
Rebel, while <i>in Possession</i> of his Estate, which it
considers as his <i>own Property</i>, and which therefore it
justly takes away for his <i>own Offence</i>. Perhaps, in Cases
of Hereditary Possessions, it may seem a little hard, because it
prevents the <i>next</i> Heir from inheriting; but if there be
any Evil or Imperfection in this, we must excuse it, for the Sake
of the Intent, which might be for the general Good, the more
effectually to deter Men from <i>treasonable Conspiracies</i>
against their Prince, whereby the Happiness of Society hath been
often greatly disturbed, and whole Kingdoms and Countries
depopulated: but in this Case, it is not strictly the Heir’s,
till he comes into Possession; for the Law, by which he may
possess hereafter, may be considered as having in it this
<i>particular</i> Exception, as to the Crime of
<i>High-Treason</i>, which, whenever it <i>occurs</i> as to the
<i>Parent</i>, renders the Son incapable, &amp;<i>c</i>. With
regard to our Laws, we may, in some Sense, be said to make them
ourselves, by our Representatives, whom we constitute for that
End: and ’tis besides very probable, that some great Men, who
formerly possessed Estates, and settled them on the Male Heirs in
their Families, from one Generation to another, might help to
make this very Law itself concerning Treason, and consequently
they could not but acquiesce with this <i>very Exception</i> to
the Right of Inheritance in their Posterity. But if it be still
said to be unjust, though necessary, ’tis no Argument; for it
<i>cannot</i> be unjust and necessary too: the Law, in this Case,
ought rather (with Submission) so far as it unjustly affects a
Man’s Children, to be alter’d; and if it robs us of the Security,
which arises from deterring the Parent, on Account of the Evils
which shall afterwards befall his Child, ’tis easy to remedy
this, by laying an <i>additional Punishment</i> on the Traitor
himself; which, as <i>Self</i> is much nearest to us all, might
better prevent the Sin of Rebellion, If the present Law be just
in itself, there can be no Objection to it; if it be unjust,
<i>no Argument</i> of any Weight can be drawn from it, in regard
to the <i>Divine Being;</i> who is holy, wise, and true, and so
are all his Appointments concerning the Children of Men.</p>
<p class="pns">To bring this kind of Reasoning of theirs up to
the Point, they should have produced a Law, which subjected the
Son (for the Father’s Offence) to the <i>same corporal</i>
Punishment with the Father, and then also they must have proved
such a Law to be just and good. But, as these Gentlemen are so
fond of bringing Instances from the <i>Practice of Men</i> in
this frail State, in Justification of their own Doctrine, I shall
present them with one or two of my own. <i>Murder</i> has
sometimes been committed under such Circumstances, that though
the Murderer has been arraigned, there hath been no room to
condemn him, all Circumstances having concurred, in the Eye of
the Law, to acquit him; <i>will the Almighty therefore acquit
him?</i> Again, on the other hand, in the Case of Murder, things
have so fallen out, as to make an innocent Person look like the
Murderer, in the Eye of the Law or Court, which has therefore
sometimes proceeded to Death itself; <i>is this Man therefore
guilty before God?</i> I have put these two Cases, purely to shew
the Absurdity of such kind of Arguments: and I hope they will
consider better of it, and advance them no farther.</p>
<p class="pns">I<span class="sc">f</span> there was such a
Covenant between G<span class="sc">od</span> and Adam, ’tis
strange <i>no Notice</i> should be taken of it in the Law given
to <i>Adam</i>, as laid down in the <i>Bible</i>, and where, of
all Places, we have most Reason to expect it—this must surely
have been the fittest Place for its Insertion—Nor is it only
absent here, for there is no positive Account of any such
Covenant in all the <i>Old Testament</i>. Besides, when the Law
was given, and threatening (in Case of Disobedience) pronounced
on <i>Adam</i>, ’twas <i>merely personal</i>—<i>In the Day</i>
thou <i>eatest thereof</i>, thou <i>shalt surely die</i>. And
when <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> had broke the Command, and
G<span class="sc">od</span> descended to judge them for it, their
Sentences were <i>personal</i> and <i>particular</i>, and no
reproaching <i>Adam</i> on the Account of Evils to be thence
brought on his Posterity, and <i>much less</i> of eternal
Damnation. The <i>Jews</i> indeed, many of whom were weak enough
to embrace any Absurdity at all, had by some Means contracted a
Notion, not altogether unlike this of <i>original Sin</i>,
probably from a Misunderstanding of the second Commandment, which
speaks of “visiting the Iniquity of the Father upon the Children,
&amp;<i>c</i>.” But ’tis highly worthy of our Notice, that
G<span class="sc">od</span> himself was <i>greatly displeased</i>
with their having imbibed this Notion, and commanded the Prophet
<i>Ezekiel</i> to refute it at large; the Substance of which I
cannot avoid setting down, it being so full to my Purpose. The
Prophet introduces it thus, <i>Ezek</i>, xviii. 2. <i>What mean
ye, that use this Proverb in Israel, The Fathers have eaten sour
Grapes, and the Children Teeth are set on edge?</i> Ver. 4.
<i>Behold all Souls are mine, as the Soul of the Father, so also
the Soul of the Son is mine: the Soul that sinneth, it shall
die</i>. The Prophet then, from <i>ver</i>. 5. to 19. puts the
<i>two Cases</i> of a <i>righteous Man’s</i> having a <i>wicked
Son</i>, and a <i>wicked Man’s</i> having a <i>righteous Son</i>,
in order to shew, that neither is the one <i>better</i> for his
Father’s Uprightness, nor the other at all <i>worse</i> for his
Father’s Wickedness; but that all is, as it should be, placed to
the Account of their own <i>Merits</i> or <i>Demerits</i>. Ver.
20. <i>The Soul that sinneth, it shall die: the Son shall not
bear the Iniquity of the Father, neither shall the Father bear
the Iniquity of the Son; the Righteousness of the Righteous shall
be upon him, and the Wickedness of the Wicked shall be upon
him</i>. Ver. 23. <i>Have I any Pleasure at all that the Wicked
should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should return
from his Ways and live?</i> Ver. 25. <i>Yet ye say, the Way of
the Lord is unequal. Hear now, O House of Israel, Is not my Way
equal? are not your Ways unequal?</i> Ver. 32. <i>For I have no
Pleasure in the Death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God:
wherefore turn your selves and live ye</i>.</p>
<p class="pn">W<span class="sc">ords</span> more positive against
this Doctrine cannot be laid together. <i>Justice</i> and
<i>Equity</i> are here, by the Almighty himself, consider’d as
the <i>very same</i>, both in G<span class="sc">od</span> and
Man; and the same Justice and Equity, which <i>He commands</i> us
to make the Rule of <i>our Actions</i>, ’tis evident <i>He
here</i> makes the Rule of his <i>own</i>. He blames them for
their false Principles, their Ignorance and Bigotry, and is not a
little offended, because they thought him capable of acing in so
evil and unrighteous a Manner, as that would be, of <i>punishing
the Child for the Parent’s Offence;</i> and strongly and solemnly
assures them, he will do no such Thing. And as Justice and Equity
would not bear it then, it is plain that, G<span class=
"sc">od</span> could never take any such cruel and disreputable
Measures, either in the Beginning, or at any time afterwards;
because, to act thus at the Creation of Man, and disdain the
Imputation with Indignation afterwards, argues a strange
Inconsistency in the Conduct of G<span class="sc">od</span>
towards Men; but the Truth is, the same Reasons which made him
abhor the Imputation afterwards, could not but infallibly prevent
his making any such unrighteous Covenant in the Beginning. What
would you think of a Man, who is a Villain to-day, and boasts
much of his great Honesty tomorrow? The <i>Appearance</i> of
<i>Christ</i> in the Flesh was, we are told by these Gentlemen,
on Account of <i>Adam’s</i> Transgression, without which it would
have been, they say, wholly superfluous. But the Expediency or
End of <i>Christ’s</i> coming, may be resolved into the <i>Love
of</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>, on the <i>one hand;</i>
pitying the Ignorance and Folly of Mankind, on the <i>other:</i>
and whether this State was the Effect of <i>Adam’s</i> Sin, or of
their <i>own</i> personal Demerits, it makes <i>no Difference</i>
in this Case. Whoever looks carefully into the Evangelists, will
find abundant Reason to disapprove and condemn this Doctrine of
<i>Original Sin</i>, and of <i>Christ’s</i> coming into the World
on <i>that Account only</i>. Our Saviour, had this been the Case,
would either have plainly express’d, or have given some strong
Intimations concerning it: Yet no such thing appears; but the
contrary, to a <i>Demonstration</i>, from no less than two
Passages of Scripture, recorded by St. <i>Mark</i>, (ix. 36.)
When the Disciples had been privately contending for Preheminence
above each other, our Saviour, to rebuke this aspiring Spirit,
sets before them, as a Pattern of Simplicity and Innocence, a
little Child; which must have been very absurd, according to the
Notion of <i>Original Sin:</i> The second is <i>Mark</i> x.
<i>ver</i>. 13. 14. 15. 16. where <i>Christ</i> assures his
Disciples, that, in order to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
they <i>must become as little Children</i>. And in St.
<i>Matthew</i> (xviii. <i>ver</i>. 3.) this very thing is, if
possible, more <i>Strongly</i> and <i>Emphatically</i> express’d.
Which Declarations, had there been such a Thing as the Guilt of
Original Sin, <i>subjecting Children to</i> G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> <i>Wrath and Displeasure</i>, would have been
ungrounded, and erroneous in a high Degree; for if they were to
become like such a little Child, as a necessary and fit Condition
for Heaven, the Condition of Infants <i>must also</i> be suitable
to that Blessed Place—<i>Suffer little Children to come unto me,
and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</i>.
The Word S<span class="sc">uch</span>, is a general Term, equally
applicable to all Infants whatever: it shews their Innocence, and
how acceptable they are to the Almighty; and, consequently,
demonstrates the Doctrine of <i>Original Sin</i> to be Spurious
and Erroneous: as is also the Practice of <i>Infant Baptism</i>,
in Support of which, this very Text is wisely alledged; whereas
the Text itself assures us, that Children are <i>already</i>, by
Nature, in that <i>same State</i> of Innocence, which
<i>Baptism</i> is design’d to procure them: and how vain the
Ceremony, under such a Circumstance, must be, is <i>too
evident</i> to need Explaining.</p>
<p class="pns">B<span class="sc">ut</span> suppose there was such
a Covenant, our Condition, in point of Innocence, is just the
same as it would be without it; we could have no manner of
Concern with <i>Adam’s</i> Transgression: and our Innocence in
either Case being <i>exactly</i> the same, G<span class=
"sc">od</span> cannot but look upon us (in our natural State,
before we commit Sin) as Creatures that never did any thing to
offend him, and consequently be gracious and kind to us; for to
leave us in this State, to suffer everlasting Torment, is worse
than a Breach of Promise made to the Elect; and if we are as
innocent, as tho’ no such Covenant had ever been made,
G<span class="sc">od</span> cannot but regard us accordingly: and
this proves that such a Covenant could never be made, because to
no good or valuable End.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">am</span> fearful of swelling
this Pamphlet, beyond its intended Bounds; yet so fast do my
Thoughts, on this Subject, multiply and enlarge themselves, that
I must beg Leave to Say a small Matter, concerning that
<i>Propensity to Evil</i>, which we are told is derived from
<i>Adam</i>, as a Fruit and Proof of his first and original
Offence. If <i>Adam</i>’s Sin had this Influence on his
Posterity; as the Act, which produced it, was <i>one</i> and the
<i>same;</i> and all his Posterity standing in the same Relation
to him, as their Federal Head; ’tis evident, in this View of the
Matter, that <i>this</i> Bias to Evil, must in <i>all</i> be
<i>uniform</i> and <i>alike:</i> but the contrary seems
demonstrable, from undoubted and incontestable Experience; some
Children having <i>much stronger Propensities to Evil</i>, than
others: And if Part of this can be resolved into something
besides the <i>Influence</i> of <i>Adam’s first
Transgression</i>, and <i>subsequent</i> to the <i>Fall;</i> it
lies (I think) on our Adversaries to shew clearly, why every
Propensity to Sin, may not likewise be resolved into something
besides, and <i>subsequent</i> to, this <i>original
Transgression</i>. But allowing we are born into the World, with
this <i>Propensity to Evil</i>, and that we derive it from
<i>Adam’s</i> Sin; yet if G<span class="sc">od</span> be
<i>merciful</i>, he could never leave us in this deplorable
Condition; nor would his <i>Impartiality</i> admit of
<i>redeeming</i> the one Part of Mankind in a mere arbitrary
Manner, and <i>leaving</i> the other <i>to perish</i>. Nor can
much Righteousness be expected from the <i>Justice</i> of that
Being, whose Mercy can be an idle and unconcerned Spectator, in
so very moving, piteous, and Miserable a Circumstance. As to
<i>Adam’s</i> Posterity, where is the Difference to them, whether
their present weak and despoiled Condition (as these Men deem it)
be the immediate Work of <i>Creation</i> itself, or the
<i>Effect</i> of <i>Adam’s Sin</i>, and Abuse of his intellectual
Powers. We are what we are by <i>Necessity</i>, strict
<i>Necessity:</i> and though it may be called <i>moral
Necessity</i>, in order to palliate and distinguish it from that
which is natural; it operates on us, to all Intents and Purposes,
equally the same; and the giving it a milder Name, looks like a
sophistical Artifice. If Man’s Nature be impaired by the Act of
another, G<span class="sc">od</span>, as a <i>just</i> and
<i>good</i> Being, will either abate of the Rigour of his
original Law, or replenish and restore our decayed Powers.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> <i>same Goodness</i>
(if these Gentlemen will allow it was <i>Goodness</i>) which
prompted the Almighty to make Man such an excellent and blessed
Creature in the Beginning, must also prevail with him, to look
even on <i>Adam</i> himself with an Eye of Pity and Compassion,
after he had sinned; and much more must he be inclined to provide
for the <i>Restoration</i> of his Off-spring, who themselves had
not <i>actually</i> sinned, but yet had their Natures impaired by
the <i>Fall</i>. Besides, if Man was first enslaved by the Devil,
not of <i>Force</i>, but by <i>Fraud</i> and <i>Temptation;</i>
and J<span class="sc ls2">esus</span> C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> be a kind of <i>Chieftain</i>, set up
against Antichrist; his Method of <i>Recovery</i> must be as
extensive as the <i>Fall</i>—Why does he save some? but as they
are Objects of Mercy, and to recover, with a just Indignation,
Souls, originally G<span class="sc">od’s</span> own, out of the
Hand of an Usurper, Tyrant, and Destroyer. How can these Reasons
operate as to a Part, and have no Influence as to the Remainder?
The more I reflect upon the Doctrine, and view it in every light,
the more terrifying and deformed it appears: and there is no
Argument, short of God’s <i>Sovereignty</i>, that will relieve
the Difficulty; which admitted, will bring on and multiply ten
thousand greater Evils.</p>
<p class="pns">I<span class="sc">t</span> may here be proper to
take notice of a new Argument, urged in its full Strength, and
with all the Advantage of Rhetorick and Eloquence, by the most
ingenious Dr. <i>I—c W—s</i>, in a Book intituled, <i>The Ruin
and Recovery of Mankind;</i> &amp;<i>c</i>. We are there told,
that this <i>covenant</i> seems to have been, evidently,
calculated for the best; because <i>Adam</i>, in that State of
Understanding and Innocence, was more likely to stand, and
maintain his Innocence, than any of his Posterity, especially
when he consider’d himself as acting for <i>all</i> his
Posterity; with which the Doctor supposes him to have been fully
and strongly apprised; as indeed he ought, had the Case been as
the Doctor believes. This Argument I take him to have mistaken
both ways, <i>viz</i>. by extolling <i>Adam’s</i> Condition, on
the one hand, beyond what in reality it ever was, and setting
that of his Posterity much lower than it really is: and these
Errors are productive of many others. <i>Adam</i> is supposed to
have been without any Pain, or Uneasiness, and that he would so
have remained, during his Innocence: But after C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> has removed the Curse, and taken away the
Sin of his own <i>Chosen</i> Children, bodily Pains and outward
Afflictions are sometimes their Lot, why might not Man, in his
original State of Innocence, be subject, in some Degree, to Pain
and Disease? if <i>Creation</i> were inconsistent with such a
mixt Dispensation of Good and Evil, why not <i>Redemption?</i> If
G<span class="sc">od</span>, for the Exercise of Man’s Fidelity,
placed him where he was exposed to the Evil and Danger of
Temptation; why not suffer his Patience to be exercised, at some
Seasons, by Pain and Inquietude? To return to this
<i>Covenant</i>, could it be proved to have been as the Doctor
imagines, I see not what could be gained by it: because it would
be trifling to a considerable Degree. And all the Arguments, used
by <i>Milton</i>, in his third Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, to
shew the Absurdity of that Doctrine, which considers <i>Adam</i>
as <i>acting</i>, or rather as <i>being acted, by Necessity</i>,
in that Situation of Paradise, would be equally applicable to all
the Elect, under the absolute Slavery of the <i>Fall</i>.</p>
<p class="pns">W<span class="sc">here</span> is the Use of
<i>Reason</i>, or <i>Moral Agency</i>, in Man, if another be
substituted to act in his Stead, and not he himself? Man, being
made a <i>free</i> and <i>moral</i> Agent, has Power to act for
himself, and can be accountable for no body’s Crimes but his own.
The <i>Consciousness</i> of being a Sinner, belongs only to him,
that <i>actually</i> sinneth, or omitteth his Duty. Enthusiasm
indeed, which, in its highest Stages, is a kind of spiritual
Madness, may have on some Minds a quite different Effect; and the
Poor Soul, that is subject to this gloomy and tyrannical
Principle, may conceit strange things; it may at one Time imagine
itself under the Guilt of <i>Adam’s</i> Sin, which it never
committed; and fancy itself a Saint in J<span class=
"sc ls2">esus</span> C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span> (and what
not) at another: it is a mad Principle, fruitful of false
Doctrines, Chimeras, and Monsters. It matters not whether (as in
the Case of <i>Natural Madness</i>) the Reason be lost, or
whether (as in that of <i>Enthusiasm</i>) it be over-power’d, and
brought into subjection to False Principles. The Effect is the
same; and between Powers that are suffered to lie dormant, and no
Powers at all, there is here no material Distinction to be made.
Again, this Notion of <i>Adam’s</i> being more likely to stand
than his Posterity, is a mere Fallacy: it supposes a Difference
of State, and Rectitude of Mind, between him and us; which, if
true, will likewise suppose, that our State being more weak and
defenceless than his, the Task or Duty, assigned us, must be
proportionate to our different and inferior Abilities. If
<i>Adam</i> was put into this State, as <i>The Ruin and
Recovery</i> seems to suppose, from a Motive of Love in
G<span class="sc">od</span>, to his Creatures, in order to
prevent the Misery of the Human Race; the same Love cannot fail
to commiserate the Case, and to provide an effectual Remedy for
all such as are included in the Covenant. <i>Adam’s</i> Motive to
Obedience must (we are told) have been greatly strengthened by
this Consideration, That on <i>Him</i> depended the Happiness,
not of <i>himself</i> only, but of <i>all his Posterity</i>. But,
I believe, Experience will tell us, that if the Consideration of
a Man’s own Future State, placed in the strongest Light (as this
Book supposes before <i>Adam</i>) be not sufficient to move to
Obedience, a Regard to others will seldom have any considerable
Influence: Such a Covenant enter’d into, or rather arbitrarily
imposed on <i>Adam</i> by his Maker, could not fail to awaken, in
so holy and knowing a Creature, some very uneasy and disquieting
Suspicions. This Covenant, and <i>Partial Election</i> thence
following after the <i>Fall</i>, will, if rightly considered,
appear very iniquitous and oppressive: because it makes no proper
Difference between the <i>Righteous</i> and the <i>Wicked</i>. If
<i>Adam</i> had been considered as a private Person only; and
<i>all his Posterity</i> left to stand or fall, by their own
Merits or Demerits; some of those, whom this Doctrine adjudges to
everlasting Condemnation, would doubtless have been so
<i>wise</i> and <i>happy</i>, as to have pleased G<span class=
"sc">od</span> in their Generation; while others, on the
contrary, would have sinned, and transgressed his Laws. The State
of the latter is, you see, the same as it would have been, upon
the vulgar Notion of <i>Adam’s Sin;</i> or rather the Guilt of it
being, in virtue of this Covenant, imputed to them: The other and
better Part, in virtue of this Doctrine, are miserable, and must
therefore have abundant and bitter Cause of Complaint against the
Doctrine itself. I therefore think it was impossible, such a
Covenant should ever be proposed to <i>Adam;</i> a Covenant
which, if ratified, tended only to make those wretched and
miserable, who without it, had they been left to shift for
themselves, would have used their Liberty and Rational Powers
aright, and have pleased and obtained G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> Favour thereby. To talk of its being of general
Service, can never be of sufficient Authority to silence this
Argument. No <i>private Injuries</i> can be excused to
<i>innocent Sufferers</i> (and much less that of <i>eternal
Torment</i>) on the Score of general Good; what is it to them,
whether <i>they only</i>, or <i>all Mankind</i> suffer. If
<i>Adam</i> had stood, these very Men, (who would, had they been
left to their Liberty, have proved obedient) would have been in
no wise bettered; as he failed, Misery came on those, who would
otherwise have been happy. As to those who would, in the Course
of their Liberty, have sinned; this Covenant, had <i>Adam</i>
stood, would (’tis true) have saved them from the Sentence of
<i>Condemnation</i>. Take it again the other way: <i>Adam’s
Fall</i> could make no Alteration in the State of those who,
without it, would have been Sinners; such as would have proved
virtuous and happy, are hereby made miserable. These are, or must
have been the Consequences of such a Covenant strictly observed;
and the Wisdom and Equity of all Covenants must be judged of, by
comparing the good and evil Consequences, necessarily resulting
from them. All the Good such a Covenant could possibly pretend
to, had it been kept, was, the saving from Wrath such as, without
it, would, as free Beings, have sinned; and if, for their Sakes,
and to prevent the Evil that might otherwise befall them, such a
Covenant was worthy of G<span class="sc">od</span> to make with
Man, a Day of Grace and Salvation, extended for their Recovery,
after they might have transgressed, would have been equally
worthy of G<span class="sc">od</span>; and we need not recur to
such Fictions and Chimeras. One would think it incumbent on all
Legislators, to consider well the Consequences of every Law they
enact; for the preferring a Law, whose Consequences can at best
be of no Service, and will probably in the main Event of Things
be more evil and pernicious than otherwise, would be preferring
Evil to Good; in as great Proportion as the Evil might exceed the
Good: and how such a Constitution could be better for Mankind, I
do not understand. I am sorry any body, especially the Author of
<i>The Ruin and Recovery</i>, should imbibe and defend such
erroneous Opinions, and this too, in Opposition to other and
nobler Sentiments of his own, elsewhere delivered.</p>
<p class="pns">B<span class="sc">ut</span>, thus it is to be
enslaved to the mere Letter of the <i>Bible</i>, under a Notion
of doing it <i>just Honour</i>, when, on the contrary, ’tis the
ready way to <i>dishonour</i> and <i>lessen</i> its
Authority.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> Pains which Infants
suffer, and the many Miseries to which they are exposed, are, by
this Gentleman, consider’d as so many Arguments of the Guilt of
<i>Original Sin</i>. He thinks that, without such a Supposition,
the <i>Justice</i> of G<span class="sc">od</span> cannot be
vindicated. [I wish he would stick true to that Argument.] We
must, he thinks, suppose one of these two Things: either, <i>That
G<span class="sc">od</span> punishes them without all Cause or
Reason</i>, or, <i>That they are under the Curse and Condemnation
of</i> Adam’<i>s Sin:</i> and the latter is, in his Opinion, the
best Sentiment. But I am of a contrary Opinion, and think that in
either Case, the <i>Injustice</i> is the same. He <i>allows</i>
it in the <i>one Case;</i> and I hope it is <i>proved</i> in the
other: and really the Picture which this Gentleman has drawn of
our young Innocents, is very dreadful and terrifying. If all the
<i>Evils</i> that befall them in this Life, and <i>Eternal
Damnation</i> afterwards, be no more than a <i>just</i>
Punishment for their <i>Sins</i>, our <i>Saviour</i> must surely
have been <i>greatly out</i>, in the Encomiums he bestows on
their <i>Innocence</i>, as I observed before; or, the Kingdom of
Heaven, instead of being design’d for <i>upright holy Souls</i>,
may be a Receptacle for the worst of human Race.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> Brute Creation undergo
Pain and Affliction; is <i>Adam’s</i> Sin, therefore, imputed to
them? If not, and they sometimes suffer by Pain and Abuse, why
may not Infants do the same? The Miseries of the human Race,
reckon’d up and aggravated thro’ so many elaborate Pages, cannot
all of them be supposed to belong to the <i>Original
Constitution</i> of Things, but might be partly owing to the
Effect of Time and Accident, as well as to the Folly and
Wickedness of particular Persons and Nations. This Objection,
drawn from the Sufferings of Brute Animals, the Doctor endeavours
to answer: I wonder <i>Adam</i> is not considered (for the sake
of putting an End to the Difficulty) as their Federal Head. He
thinks, however, that Brutes must be some way or other included
in the <i>Curse;</i> and may be punished, as Man’s Property: But
has Man, because they are his Property, a Right to grieve and
afflict them? They were bestowed as a Blessing, for reasonable
Service and Delight, not for cruel Treatment and Abuse. The
Doctor’s Rule of Faith will tell him, <i>A merciful Man will be
merciful to his Beast</i>. If their being Man’s Property will not
justify him in abusing or cruelly handling them; it can be no
Reason or Argument, why another should do it, even the Almighty
himself. Consider Beasts, then, as G<span class="sc">od’s</span>
own Property; will that render it a whit more equitable? No: This
the Doctor himself, in the Case of Infants, allows would be
cruel, and contrary to the Divine Justice and Goodness: and the
Argument is the same as to Brutes. But the Doctor, sensible of
the Weakness of this Argument, has recourse to another, which I
believe will always be admired as a standing Mark of
<i>extraordinary Invention</i>, to get rid of difficult and
perplexing Questions. Brutes may, it seems, contrary to common
Experience, have Sensations <i>less Quick</i> and <i>Painful</i>
than ours. I wonder he allows them any Sensation at all; nay,
’tis doubtful if he does allow it. Noise, or Crying out, in them,
is, it seems, no Mark of Pain, because some Brutes, under the
same Circumstance, remain quiet and still. But will the Doctor
say, they have therefore no painful Sensations? Are there no
Marks of Pain besides those of crying aloud? Did the Doctor never
know a Man sometimes bear a pretty deal of Pain without crying
out at all; and give many external Tokens of Pain, at another
Time? Did he never perceive a <i>gaul’d Horse</i> wince, upon the
most gentle Approach of the Hand; and discover Signs of the
greatest Fear, and most <i>exquisite Pains?</i> Do not some
Brutes take as much Pains to avoid the Discipline of the Whip, as
tho’ their Sensations were the same as ours? I am ashamed to
waste Time upon such a Subject; tho’ I hope to be pardoned for
following so great a Man in his own Method of arguing. He perhaps
may continue of the same Mind, and there may be no Hopes of
Convincement, till Brutes are taught to speak. By this new Way of
Reasoning, the Ground we tread upon, and every Thing around us,
hitherto thought Inanimate, may be full of Cogitation. If
affording the common Marks of Sensation, be no Proof, that Brutes
have it in a common Degree, Wanting the common Marks of
Intelligence, can be no Proof that a Stock or a Stone has it not.
If I mistake not, Bishop <i>Berkley</i> has furnished the World
with something equally instructive and philosophical, in relation
to the Existence of Matter; which, he endeavours to prove
<i>not</i> to be a <i>real</i>, but an <i>ideal</i> and
<i>imaginary Being</i>. I shall leave others to guess, in what
Condition those must be, who think and reason after this
extraordinary Manner. But the Doctor has yet another Argument in
reserve, to vindicate G<span class="sc">od’s</span>
Justice—<i>Tho’ Brutes suffer, yet they may</i> it seems <i>have
upon the whole more Pleasure than Pain</i>. But do not some
Brutes partake very deeply of the former, in this Life; will the
Doctor therefore suppose a Future State for them, by way of
Compensation? But this Argument ruins the whole Affair, and may
be turned against the Doctor himself, in the Case of Infants, who
may be made ample Amends in a future State, for the Evils
sustained here, which Evils may have other Causes besides
<i>Original Sin;</i> for here again, as in the Case of a
Propensity to Evil, Pain in Infants, if inflicted because of
<i>Adam’s Sin</i>, must in <i>all</i> be <i>uniform</i> and
<i>alike</i>. But the Fact being quite otherwise, some of this
Pain and Evil must be resolved into <i>other Causes;</i> and if
<i>some</i>, why not <i>all?</i> I grant indeed, that <i>Adam</i>
himself might have so far corrupted his Nature, as to render him
more liable to Pain, than in a State of true Innocence he might
have been, and that therefore he might be instrumental to
propagate the Seeds of several Diseases, to his Posterity: But
had he never done this, his Successors might have done it; and
<i>every Age</i> has, perhaps, by Intemperance and
Lasciviousness, been adding to the common Stock of human Diseases
and Calamities: Propensities to Vice might also be propagated in
the same Way, and that, and nothing besides, can (I think)
account so well for their great and infinite Variety. The Doctor,
with the rest of his Brethren, are perpetually urging those
common-place Arguments, drawn from the Practice of Men; which in
the general I have answer’d already: and, had I proper Leisure,
it would be no difficult Matter to give a clear and distinct
Answer to every one of them: And these very Gentlemen would, on
other Occasions, had they no favourite Point to carry, reject
such Reasoning with all the Contempt, and Indignation, it
deserves. It is with some Reluctance, I find myself obliged to
disapprove the Sentiments of such wise and worthy Grey Hairs, to
whom the World hath been long and deeply indebted for his many
excellent Services, both from the Pen and the Pulpit. I have read
over Mr. <i>J—s</i>’s Book, in Answer to Taylor’s <i>Free and
Candid Examination;</i> and tho’ I have no personal Knowledge of
that ingenious Gentleman, yet I hope he will permit me to say,
’Tis pity, great pity, that fine Talents (pardon the Expression)
should be prostituted in the Defence of such an unholy and
incongruous System of Religion. Superior Degrees of Learning and
Knowledge are, in themselves, most excellent Things, and
eminently serviceable, when rightly applied to the Honour and
Defence of Truth: But, like a two edged Sword, they cut both
ways, and are also too frequently employed in the Propagation of
Error.</p>
<p class="pns">W<span class="sc">hile</span> I am thus rendering
<i>human Learning</i>, its just Tribute of Praise, <i>Truth</i>
requires, that I should be free to detect those little Arts, so
often practised to deceive the Unwary, and misguide Mankind. As I
am fully persuaded, the Generality of those Writers; who stick by
this <i>Covenant</i>, and endeavour to vindicate the Honour,
Justice, and Goodness of G<span class="sc">od</span> therein, do
it <i>only</i> for Decency sake, <i>and to put</i> (<a href=
"#p19">as I observed</a>) <i>a more plausible Outside on their
Doctrines;</i> I think it incumbent on me to <i>detect</i> this
<i>equivocal</i> Way of Writing, and shew, that while the Doctor
is endeavouring to persuade you he <i>does not</i> believe these
Doctrines in their most <i>harsh</i> and <i>severe</i> Sense,
there is Reason to suspect he does notwithstanding,
<i>secretly</i> and <i>strongly</i>, believe them in that <i>very
Sense:</i> nay, he seems to resolve <i>them</i> very artfully
into the <i>Sovereignty</i> and <i>Majesty of God</i>. Any Man,
who reads the Book, may perceive, how greatly the Doctor is
<i>put to it</i> for <i>Arguments</i>, to answer
<i>Objections;</i> and he himself knows it to be impossible to
make any tolerable or reasonable Defence, of such unreasonable
and unaccountable Doctrines: and therefore, lest his <i>own
People</i> should, from some Expressions, which, at first sight,
might look as though he was arguing merely upon a Principle of
<i>moral Fitness</i>, suspect his Sincerity, he has (Second
Edition, <i>Page</i> 274) given strong Intimations of his Faith,
as follows:</p>
<p class="pns">“The Doctrine of <i>Reprobation</i>, in the most
<i>severe</i> and <i>absolute</i> Sense of it, stands in such a
direct Contradiction to all our Notions of Kindness and Love to
others, in which the <i>blessed God</i> is set forth as our
Example, that our Reason cannot tell how to receive it; yet if it
were never so true, and never so plainly revealed in Scripture,
it would only be a Doctrine which would require our humble
Assent, and silent Submission to it; with awful Reverence of the
Majesty and Sovereignty of the great G<span class="sc">od</span>,
&amp;<i>c</i>.”</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">his</span> proves, I think
clearly, on what Authority the Doctor himself believes these
<i>Doctrines;</i> and whoever knows, how <i>common</i> it is for
Men of <i>this</i> Faith, to make a specious Shew of reasoning
with others on a Principle of moral Fitness, and among
themselves, without Scruple, resolving all into mere
<i>Sovereignty</i>, will not think I have been too forward or
severe in my Observation. I <i>humbly</i> presume, what I have
offer’d against this Notion of <i>God’s Sovereignty</i>, is a
plain Confutation of the Doctor; and I here, with all due
Submission, invite <i>him</i>, or any of his <i>Brethren</i>, to
defend <i>the Doctrines;</i> and <i>this Quotation</i>, against
me. If they <i>do really</i> resolve these Doctrines into
<i>God’s Sovereignty</i>, let them speak it out plainly; if they
<i>do not</i> believe them in this Sense, let them speak that out
plainly too; that we may clearly understand, in what
<i>determinate Sense</i>, they do believe them.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> Doctor has taken a
great deal of Pains to make the World believe, that C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> died for all Men, when it does not appear,
that he himself believes any such thing. Hear him, <i>Page</i>
89, “And methinks, when I take my justest Survey of this lower
World, with all the Inhabitants of it, I can look upon it no
otherwise, than as a huge and magnificent Structure in Ruins, and
turned into a Prison, and a Lazar-house, or Hospital; wherein lie
Millions of Criminals, and Rebels against their Creator, under
Condemnation to Misery and Death, who are at the same time sick
of a mortal Distemper, and disorder’d in their Minds, even to
Distraction: Hence proceed those infinite Follies, which are
continually practised here; and the righteous Anger of an
offended G<span class="sc">od</span> is visible in ten thousand
Instances: yet there are Proclamations of Divine Grace, Health,
and Life, sounding amongst them; either with a louder Voice, or
in gentler Whispers, though very few of them take any Notice
thereof. But of this great Prison, this Infirmary, there is here
and there one who is called powerfully, by Divine Grace, and
attends to the Office of Reconciliation, and complies with the
Proposals of Peace; his Sins are pardoned, he is healed of his
worst Distemper; and tho’, his Body is appointed to go down to
the Dust, for a Season, yet his Soul is taken upwards to a Region
of Blessedness; while the Bulk of these miserable and guilty
Inhabitants, perish in their own wilful Madness and by the just
Executions of Divine Anger.”</p>
<p class="pns">As I have hitherto troubled the Reader with little
Quotation, and it being now so necessary to let us into the
<i>true Spirit</i> of the Doctor’s Belief, notwithstanding any
seeming Appearance to the contrary, I hope to be pardoned. You
perceive here, that <span class="sc">all</span> are called, but
the <i>greatest Part</i>, in such a weak and imperfect Manner,
that is out of <i>their Power</i> to embrace the Call, and so
they perish as <i>unavoidably</i> and <i>unjustly</i>, as though
no such Call were extended. The Distinction, which is here made
between moral and natural Necessity, the Doctor thinks sufficient
to silence all Objections, <i>Page</i> 285. I have endeavour’d to
shew the contrary, and I hope with better Success. Again, what
the Doctor observes, <i>Page</i> 245, is worthy of
Notice,—“Though there must be a <i>very good Sense</i>, in which
<i>Christ</i> may be said to die for all Men, because the
Scripture uses this Language; yet it does not follow, that the
Doctrine of Universal Redemption is found there: I cannot find
that Scripture once asserts that <i>Christ</i> redeemed all Men,
or <i>died</i> to redeem them all.”</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">his</span> is, I think,
manifestly a <i>Contradiction</i>, and the Doctor, it seems,
believes it, only because the Scripture, as he thinks, reveals
it. Where is the Difference between <i>dying to save all Men</i>,
and, <i>dying to redeem all Men?</i> And yet <i>Jesus Christ</i>,
it seems, did the one, but not the other. According to him (the
Doctor) the Scripture assures us, that is, the Word of
G<span class="sc">od</span> assures us, <span class=
"sc">both</span> that <i>Christ did</i>, and that he <i>did
not</i> <span class="sc">die</span> to redeem all Mankind; which
is a flat Contradiction. In what good Sense, I should be glad to
know, could <i>Christ</i> be said to <i>die</i> for <i>all
Men</i>, when G<span class="sc">od</span> purposely, and
peremptorily, <i>with-holds</i> proper Assistances to restore the
<i>greatest Part?</i> If this be to die for <i>all Men</i>, it is
certainly not in a good, but in a very bad Sense. But, perhaps,
the <i>Doctor</i> means, <i>that Man, consider’d in his primitive
Rectitude, has Power sufficient to obey the Gospel as proposed to
Sinners, and that</i> Adam’s <i>Posterity, consider’d as fallen
in him, are under the same Obligation to keep the Law, as</i>
Adam <i>was</i>. But of this I have already taken due Notice, and
therefore I need only put the Doctor in mind of a few Words of
his, drop’d <i>Page</i> 340, in his <i>Consideration of the State
of dying Infants</i>. He thinks, “it would be by no Means
agreeable, to have them condemned to a wretched Resurrection and
eternal Misery, only because they were born of <i>Adam</i>, the
original Transgressor.” This is a rational Sentiment, and I wish
it were well improved; for it is better to suppose them entering
on a new State of Trial, or downright Annihilation to be their
Portion: But what Havock does this Concession make with the
Doctor’s other Doctrines, of <i>Christ’s dying for all Men in a
good Sense, of considering us in point of Obligation to keep the
Law inviolable, the same as Adam was before his Fall;</i> of
G<span class="sc">od</span>’s either granting <i>no Aids</i> to
enable us to <i>do this</i>, or <span class="sc">such</span>
<i>as are too weak and insufficient to enable us thereto!</i> We
are, he allows, <i>under a moral Incapacity to keep the Law</i>,
but not a <i>natural</i> Incapacity, and therefore G<span class=
"sc">od</span> may justly exact our Obedience. But pray consider,
if both a <i>moral</i> and <i>natural</i> Ability be requisite to
keep G<span class="sc">od</span>’s Laws, what signifies which of
these is wanting, when we may as well be without <i>both</i>, as
without <i>either</i>. It signifies little, what Epithets we
bestow on the Word <i>Necessity</i>. Wherever it prevails; and
whether it be <i>moral</i> or <i>natural</i>, if it is not
<i>self-caused</i>, but comes on Man, either by the immediate
Decree of Heaven, or by the <i>Act of another</i>, it is
<i>Necessity</i>, <i>irresistible Necessity</i>, and no
Distinction can palliate it.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">allow</span> indeed, when Man
is created upright, and furnished with sufficient Understanding
and Ability to please the Almighty; and yet, <i>abusing</i> his
Liberty, becomes at length so enslaved to his Passions and
Appetites, as to fall into this <i>moral Debility</i>, the Law of
G<span class="sc">od</span> is still his Duty to observe: On the
other hand, allowing Mankind to have lost their <i>moral
Ability</i> to practise Virtue in the Fall of <i>Adam</i>, and
that G<span class="sc">od</span>, taking Pity upon Man, grants
him sufficient <i>Light</i>, to discern his State, and sufficient
<i>Power</i>, to obtain Redemption from it, this Man is also
under the <i>same Obligation</i> to keep the Law of G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, as though his moral Powers had never sustained
any <i>Decay</i> or <i>Loss</i> in <i>Adam;</i> and I dare
affirm, that in <i>no</i> other Sense, can Man be accountable for
the Pravity of his Will. And let the Doctor observe this,—If it
would be unsuitable to the Mercy of G<span class="sc">od</span>,
in the Case of Infants not committing actual Sin, to punish them
eternally, <i>only because they were born of this first
Transgressor</i>, would it not be equally unkind, to leave such
as arrive at mature Age, under the Power of those <i>restless</i>
and <i>irresistable</i> Propensities to Evil, derived from
<i>Adam</i>, and to punish <i>them</i> eternally, only because
these Propensities, derived in virtue of being born of the first
Transgressor, constantly, and <i>in spite</i> of any thing we are
able, considered in a moral and natural Sense, to do to the
contrary, produce <i>Vice</i> and <i>immorality?</i> <i>All</i>
evil Actions, consequent upon this Propensity, are, in fact, as
necessary and unavoidable to us, as the Propensity itself,
<i>Where</i> then, in point of Innocence, can the Difference be,
<i>between</i> having imputed Guilt and this Propensity, in Time
of Infancy, and living long enough in this World, to feel, and
shew to others, its arbitrary Effects, in producing Vice and
Impiety whether we will or no? and where then is the Reason, for
such very different Treatment of Infants and adult Persons? I
must observe one Thing—The Doctor and his Brethren, as they make
the Work of Salvation, a very easy and agreeable Thing to the
Elect, on the one hand; so they assign the poor Sinner a very
<i>hard Task</i>, on the other: <i>He that offends in one Point
is</i>, they say, <i>guilty of breaking the whole Law</i>. Here
is a <i>plain Instance</i> of taking <i>Scripture</i> in a
literal Sense, when it can by no Means be so understood.
According to this, a Man, that only <i>steals</i>, may be said to
commit Murder, and be <i>punished</i> as a Murderer as well as a
Thief; though we know he has not committed it.</p>
<p class="pns">I<span class="sc">n</span> the main, we may
conscientiously observe and keep G<span class="sc">od’s</span>
Laws, and yet in Time of <i>Temptation</i> and <i>Weakness</i>
fall into some Evil, will, G<span class="sc">od</span> therefore
<i>consider</i> and <i>punish</i> us as those who live in the
daily Breach and Contempt of all his Laws? No! For, on the
contrary, G<span class="sc">od</span> ever waits to be gracious
to all such, as through Inadvertence fall into Sin, and are
willing to forsake it. The View and Intent of our Apostle, in
these Words, seems to be of very <i>easy</i> and <i>plain</i>
Signification: There was in those early Times, as appears from
our Saviour’s frequently reproving the Hypocrisy of that
Generation, a Sort of People, who appeared zealous in the
Externals of Religion, while at the same Time they neglected
Things of far <i>greater Moment:</i> <i>Woe unto you Scribes and
Pharisees, ye pay Tithe of Mint and Cummin; and have omitted the
weightier Matters of the Law:</i> Mat. xxiii. <i>ver</i>. 23.
They daringly violated G<span class="sc">od’s</span> Laws in some
of the most material and important Instances, and complied with
others in a mere formal ostentatious Way; and were therefore
guilty, in the Divine View, of the Breach of the <i>whole
Law;</i> for <i>mere Obedience</i> upon improper Motives to a
<i>Part</i> of the Law, while at the same Time they allow’d
themselves in the <i>known</i> and <i>deliberate</i> Violation of
<i>more weighty</i> Commands, was no true or proper Obedience at
all: and, in this Sense, the <i>Jewish</i> Sacrifices of the Law,
though commanded by the highest Authority, were always esteemed
an Abomination; and the Christian Religion as well as the Law, is
certainly liable to Abuses of the same Kind, from Men of
hypocritical and corrupt Minds, whom therefore this Doctrine of
the Apostle <i>effectually</i> and <i>peculiarly</i> regards and
reproves: and I appeal to all, if this Construction of the Sacred
Text be not more agreeable to Reason and Common Sense, than that
which the Doctor has thought fit and convenient to bestow
thereon. I beseech the Doctor to consider how, according to his
Principles, this Covenant could be proposed to <i>Adam</i>, out
of a kind and beneficent intention in the Creator, when God knew,
in the first Place, that <i>Adam</i> would not keep it, and
determined, in the second Place, upon the Breach of it, to leave
the Bulk of Mankind to perish everlastingly, without Mercy,
without sufficient or suitable Means of Redemption; and what a
<i>cruel Joke</i>, upon the <i>Calvinistical Scheme</i>, of
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> willing the <i>Fall</i>, was here
put upon <i>Adam</i>, and all his Posterity!</p>
<p class="pns">To talk as some do, of our existing in <i>Adam</i>
at the Time of his Transgression, is very absurd, when, as
<i>intelligent</i> and <i>free Creatures</i>, it is evident, we
did not exist at all. <i>Sin is a Transgression of some Law,
which we have at the same time Power to keep</i>. G<span class=
"sc">od</span> never requires Impossibilities. He that made Man,
knows best what he is capable of and hath undoubtedly taken care
to proportion the <i>Duties</i> he requires of Man, to the
<i>Powers</i> he hath bestowed on him. The contrary would be very
hard dealing indeed—If a Law be dispensed to me, I must in the
first Place have Understanding sufficient to judge of its
Authority, and the Obligations it lays me under; and, in the
second Place, I must also have Power to keep it, otherwise it can
never be a Law suitable to me; and a Man’s <i>Age</i>,
<i>Complexion</i>, <i>Stature</i>, and <i>Circumstances</i>, are
as just Causes for Damnation, as the Breach of a Law which lies
beyond the Reach of his Knowledge and Abilities. But supposing,
in the last Place, that G<span class="sc">od</span> did make such
a Covenant with <i>Adam</i>, &amp;<i>c</i>. (though I think I
have shewn it to be impossible) let us see how the Doctrines of
<i>Election</i> and <i>Preterition</i> will turn out <i>then</i>.
I have already endeavoured to make it appear, that G<span class=
"sc">od</span> does not act in that arbitrary Manner, which these
Gentlemen teach; that though he is indeed governed by no Law
without, or accountable to any for what he is pleased to do, yet
his own Rectitude of Mind, is to him an invariable Rule of
Righteousness, equally secure to all Intents and Purposes of a
written Law without: and this argues the adorable and
incomparable Excellency of his Being who, though by Nature he is
infinitely above all Power and Authority whatever, yet his moral
Perfections continually prompt him to promote the Happiness of
the meanest of his Creatures. It was <i>sovereign Goodness</i>
(rather than <i>sovereign Pleasure</i>) which prompted the
Almighty to create Man, in order to communicate Happiness to him;
and if <i>Adam’s</i> Posterity might be said to fall in him, yet
G<span class="sc">od</span> must at least look on them in a more
favourable Manner, than if they had actually sinned themselves;
and consequently it could never suit with his Goodness to punish
eternally <i>any one</i> under this Circumstance, without
<i>first giving</i> him an Opportunity of recovering from his
lapsed State; nor could he ordain the Means on Purpose to <i>save
some</i> by <i>electing Grace</i>, without <i>saving all</i>.
G<span class="sc">od</span> does nothing without sufficient
Reason: he could save none under this Circumstance, but as they
were <i>in themselves</i> Objects of his Pity and Mercy; and if
ever there was an Object of Mercy, here it is, an immortal Soul
condemned, for the Fault of <i>another</i>, which it could by no
Means hinder or prevent, to suffer eternal Torment. There is
something greatly moving in such an Object as this; and as <i>all
Adam’s</i> Posterity were equally involved in his Guilt, all are
Objects of Mercy <i>precisely the same</i>, and therefore there
is not the least Ground for the Difference which we are told is
made by Election; because ’tis making a <i>Distinction</i> where
there is <i>no Difference</i>. Here is the Race of <i>Adam</i>,
considered as <i>equally</i> fallen in him, divided into two very
unequal Parts (equally in themselves, and altogether Objects of
Mercy, if such an Object can be) by the Almighty himself. The
smaller Number he is at all Events determined to save, and to
destroy the greater Number.</p>
<p class="pns">In answer to this, I expect to hear that common,
but <i>weak</i> Argument, drawn from an <i>earthly Prince</i>,
his extending Pardon to <i>one</i> Criminal, and leaving
<i>another</i> to undergo the Execution of his Sentence. But this
is of the same <i>fallacious Kind</i>, as that drawn from the
Case of <i>Rebellion</i>, and shews how <i>very hard</i> the
Patrons of this Doctrine are put to it for Arguments. Two Men,
condemned for one Crime, may not be equally wicked, and
consequently <i>one</i> may better deserve Pity than the
<i>other</i>, and to extend it, is in itself a rational and
worthy Distinction, made between two <i>such Criminals</i>. Let
us suppose, in order to illustrate the Argument, that a Man is
<i>compelled</i>, by Thieves, to go out on the Highway, where he
plunders, and is at length, with the rest, brought to Justice;
his Sentence would doubtless be the <i>same</i> as theirs: But
when he is consider’d, as having acted not by Choice, but <i>by
Necessity</i>, he must needs be an Object of Pity. Nay, mere
Justice itself will plead strongly in his Favour. Apply this (so
far as it belongs) to the Doctrine of <i>Original Sin;</i> which
if it makes Men Sinners <i>at all</i>, it must be <i>by
Necessity</i>, there being no <i>Possibility</i> for us to
prevent it; which is equal to the greatest Constraint that can be
produced or imagined, and consequently <i>all Men</i> must, under
this Consideration, be <i>at worst</i> suitable Objects of Mercy.
Besides, the Weakness of this Argument will plainly appear, upon
considering, with respect to <i>earthly Princes</i>, that where
the Equity of making a <i>due Distinction</i> between one
<i>Criminal</i> and another, is not the Reason, why <i>one is
pardoned</i>, and the other <i>left to suffer;</i> it
<i>always</i> arises either from <i>Caprice</i>, <i>Interest</i>,
<i>Solicitation</i>, or from <i>Misrepresentation</i> of Facts to
M<span class="sc">onarchs</span>; who, too often, <i>see</i> and
<i>hear</i> through <i>others</i>, that are not always duly
conscientious, to preserve inviolable the Trust reposed in them;
and whether such Reasoning as this, can possibly affect the
<i>Almighty</i>, any Man of common Understanding may easily
judge.</p>
<p class="pns">But let them apply my Argument on the
<i>Sovereignty of</i> G<span class="sc">od</span> against the
<i>Certainty</i> of their Election, and I believe they will find
but little Reason to boast of their Doctrine of electing Grace.
They tell us indeed, that this Doctrine of theirs, makes the
Death of <i>Christ</i> of more Effect than ours, because it
secures the Salvation of <i>some</i>. But I have proved there can
be no Security in it; and surely that Doctrine, which <i>puts
all</i> into a Capacity of Salvation, must be better, than that,
which leaves <i>almost every Man</i> to perish; and if it was
better to save a few, than to save none in this arbitrary Manner,
it must still have been better and more to the Glory of
<i>Christ</i>, arbitrarily to have saved all Mankind. They say
also, that their Doctrine of Election is a much better Ground for
Love and good Works, than is that of <i>free Grace</i>. But the
contrary is apparent, because whoever thinks rightly, cannot be
without this disquieting Thought.—If G<span class="sc">od</span>,
in a mere arbitrary Manner, and without any Regard to previous
Fitness, has chosen me, and rejected another; how do I know but
his Mind may change hereafter, or that he may not reverse this
Decree? or if <i>unconditional Election</i> be the true Doctrine
of the Gospel, and Man is <i>equally dear</i> and acceptable to
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>without</i>, as he is <i>with</i>,
good Works, what Inducement can such a Person have to please
G<span class="sc">od</span> that Way, when he is already as well
pleased without them? If Election is founded upon an
<i>unconditional Decree</i>, the natural Inference (in all such
as believe the Doctrine, and themselves to be of the Elect) must
be this—If I am of the Number of the Elect, nothing can frustrate
my Happiness; I may gratify my favourite Passions, and wallow in
all Kinds of Wickedness, Luxury and Sensuality, and be equally
acceptable to the Almighty, as was <i>David</i> in the Sins of
Murder and Adultery: On the contrary, if I am not of that Number
which shall be saved, all my Pains and Obedience will never
procure me Acceptance with G<span class="sc">od</span>, and
therefore I <i>will seek</i> all possible Gratifications in this
Life, seeing it is the only Time and Place wherein I can obtain
any Thing like Happiness; nor can the Liberty I take here
increase my Misery hereafter, the <i>precise Degree</i> of
<i>that</i> being fixed along with the Decree of my Damnation:
Though this Persuasion of being set apart for everlasting
Torment, has more often the Effects of Desperation and
<i>Self-Murder;</i> and indeed the two Extremes of
<i>Presumption</i> and <i>Despair</i>, are the natural Brood and
Offspring of these Doctrines, as the reverend and learned Dr.
<i>Trapp</i> has abundantly evinced, in his excellent Discourse,
<i>against the Folly, Sin, and Danger of being righteous over
much</i>. Hypocrisy and Persecution are also the genuine
Offspring of this Faith; and <i>whenever</i> it has been tried,
Persecution has grown up to a considerable Maturity: for as they
pretend to know the Marks of elect and reprobate Men, what can be
more natural, than for those, who apprehend themselves to be the
<i>former</i>, to persecute and take Vengeance on the
<i>latter</i>. Hath not G<span class="sc">od</span>, by his own
Decree of Damnation, set them an Example? and if he has set a
Mark on the Reprobate, they (the Elect) may very reasonably, in
Imitation of the <i>Divine Conduct</i>, endeavour to make them as
wretched as possible here in this Life, and <i>who shall lay any
Thing to the Charge of G<span class="sc">od’s</span> Elect?</i> I
am now shewing, what are the genuine Effects of this Doctrine,
not charging Consequences on such as neither do <i>see</i> nor
<i>approve</i> of them: there is great Difference in the Conduct
of Men of this Principle; and its natural Effects are, by other
Things intervening, often prevented, the chief of which may, I
believe, be Want of Power and Opportunity; for tho’ many, when
out of Power, might be apt to say (as <i>Hazael</i> did) <i>what
is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this Evil?</i> yet they
would perhaps be in some Danger of behaving as that great Man
did, when he came to be tried. Some again, who tho’ they profess
the Doctrine, are yet (I doubt not) often under the Influence of
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> <i>Grace</i>, which, as it tends to
humble the Soul, and render it more loving and humane than
before, naturally prevents the Spirit of Persecution from taking
such deep Root as otherwise it might. And here, though I do not
pretend to be a <i>nice Judge</i> of the spiritual Part of
Religion, yet I have heard such as have been accounted Men of the
best Experience say, that when the Grace of G<span class=
"sc">od</span> operates on the Soul, the ardent Love of Mankind
is <i>inseparable therewith</i>. If then the better Sort of
those, who profess this Doctrine, are ever sensible of this
<i>most agreeable</i> and humbling Operation in the Soul, I ask
them, if it does not <i>naturally distend</i> and enlarge their
Wishes, in Behalf of all Mankind? and if this Spirit of Love be
the genuine Effect of the Operation of G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> Grace, what shall be said of that ineffable and
immense Fountain of Grace and Goodness, from whence it proceeds?
But, on the other hand, it has been observed, that among mere
<i>enthusiastick and traditional Believers</i>, of the Doctrine
of Election, their Hypocrisy, Deceit and Dissimulation has
overtop’d that of all the World besides, even beyond what human
Nature could be thought capable of, in its most wicked and
corrupt State; in short, they seem to have made the Deceit of
<i>Jacob</i>, and all other parallel Places of Scripture, that
furnish the worst Part of the Lives of good Men, a <i>standing
Rule</i> of Behaviour—What a blessed Company has the
L<span class="sc ls2">ord</span> set apart for himself!</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> <i>Foreknowledge</i>
of G<span class="sc">od</span> is supposed, by some, to belong to
the Argument of <i>Predestination;</i> but I think it wholly
beside my present Purpose, to enter circumstantially into it, for
<i>this Reason</i>—If, Whatever G<span class="sc">od</span>
<i>foreknows</i>, he must also of Necessity <i>foreordain;</i> it
is manifestly using <i>Foreknowledge</i> and <i>Ordination</i> to
signify just the <i>same Thing</i>, and, <i>in this Light</i>,
every Argument against <i>Fore-ordination</i>, must be equally
strong against <i>Foreknowledge</i>, so far as it affects the
Doctrines under Consideration; and when these Gentlemen can shew
the contrary, or are willing to enter into the Consideration of
the <i>Divine Foreknowledge</i>, either <i>separate from</i>, or
<i>connected with</i>, the Doctrine of <i>Fore-ordination</i>, I
shall always be ready to receive Information.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">his</span> Doctrine of electing
Grace, they exalt as an <i>incomprehensible Mystery;</i> so do
the Papists, with as good Reason, that of
<i>Transubstantiation;</i> for neither of them are Mysteries, or
incomprehensible, but <i>palpable Errors</i>, whose Absurdity we
do <i>easily and fully comprehend;</i> nor will the stale Art of
playing on the Word <i>Mystery</i> amuse us any longer. Another
strange Argument, which these Men make use of, in order to set
aside some Passages of Scripture, which are positive and express
against them, is this, <i>that if God wills the Salvation of all
Men, all must be saved, otherwise we may be said to conquer the
Will and Grace of God</i>. To which the Answer is very easy—Man
is made a <i>free Creature</i>, and therefore G<span class=
"sc">od</span> deals with him as such; because to make him free,
and then arbitrarily <i>overrule</i> his Freedom, would be making
him free to <i>no Purpose</i>. The Will of G<span class=
"sc">od</span> is sometimes <i>positive</i>, and sometimes
<i>conditional</i>. He gives Laws, commands us to keep them, and
promises eternal Life to those who obey; nor can we suppose he
commands us to obey, without willing our Obedience. We may indeed
<i>resist</i> the Operations of his Grace: but to talk of
<i>conquering</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>, is Nonsense. He
has made us free Creatures; he wills our Salvation, and has
granted us such Aids as are sufficient, if we use them aright, to
bring us to Happiness: This Conduct in the Divine Being, is not
only reasonable in itself, but <i>perfectly agreeable</i> to many
<i>plain</i> and <i>express</i> Parts of Scripture. The
<i>Weeping</i> and <i>Lamentation</i> of <i>Christ</i> over
<i>Jerusalem</i>, is a strong Proof of it: <i>How often would I
have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her
Wings; but thou wouldest not!</i> Here was all done, that was fit
and convenient to reclaim free Beings; not only proper Aids
offer’d, but offer’d in the <i>most tender</i> and affectionate
Manner, as is evident from the Comparison of the Hen,
&amp;<i>c</i>. and by the Words <i>how often</i>, is set forth
the <i>great Patience and longsuffering of God:</i> And
notwithstanding all this, they resisted to their own Destruction.
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>willed</i>, or would have saved
her, but she was stubborn and rebellious, and would not accept of
Salvation; did she therefore <i>conquer</i> the Almighty? Suppose
my Father gives me a good Education, a good Employment, and a
competent Portion in Money, and, besides all, is continually at
hand, ready further to advise and assist me, whenever it may be
necessary; yet I am obstinate and disobedient, and, by pursuing
evil Courses, fall into Poverty, Contempt, and Ruin: I may indeed
be said to <i>resist</i>, but in no <i>good Sense</i> to
<i>conquer</i> my Father. Besides, according to this absurd Way
of arguing, if G<span class="sc">od</span> does all in Believers,
his Laws are to be <i>kept</i> by himself; with what Propriety
then can they be said to be given to Man? He to whom the Law is
given is to keep it, not the Being who gives it.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">might</span> here, very
naturally, speak concerning the Sacrifice of <i>Christ’s
Death</i>, and <i>his Righteousness</i> imputed to us; but I
shall not now discuss it fully, only a few Remarks may not be
impertinent or useless. These two Points appear to me to be much
misunderstood; <i>Sin</i> is said to be infinite, because
committed against an infinite G<span class="sc">od</span>; and
that therefore nothing but an infinite Being can satisfy the
Justice of G<span class="sc">od</span> for it: A fine Story
indeed, for Men to amuse us with, who pretend to believe in
<i>only one</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>: Here is <i>one</i>
infinite Being, to be satisfied for Sin; and <i>another</i>, to
satisfy him. And, what is still as bad or worse, it supposes,
that an infinite Being may, for a certain Season, suffer or
undergo a Diminution of its Happiness; which, in an infinite and
unchangeable Being, I take to be impossible. Was it then
<i>only</i> the Person, or <i>rational Soul</i> of <i>Jesus
Christ</i>, that suffered, being upheld under it, by the infinite
Being himself? If so, what is become of the infinite Being, that
was to <i>suffer</i> for Sin; for does G<span class=
"sc">od</span> make Satisfaction to himself? ’Till these
Gentlemen either renounce, or better explain this Matter, they
will, I hope, think very favourably of all who deal in absurd
Schemes of Faith.</p>
<p class="pns">T<span class="sc">he</span> Thing productive of
these Absurdities, is a <i>wrong Notion</i> of Sin, and of the
Justice of G<span class="sc">od</span>: Sin, they say, is
infinite, because <i>committed against an infinite G<span class=
"sc">od</span></i>. It is doubtless sometimes a great Aggravation
of it, that it is committed against G<span class="sc">od</span>;
but it is not so much his <i>Greatness</i>, as our abusing his
<i>Goodness</i>, that aggravates the Crime: As may appear from
this short Observation, That any Favour, disinterestedly done, by
a Person of the meanest Rank in Life, lays the Receiver under the
same Obligation, as though it were granted by the greatest Man
upon Earth: It is the Motive and the Action, put together, that
gives it its proper Value to the Receiver. G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> Authority may add some kind of Sanction but no
Alteration of outward Circumstances, in him who confers a
Benefit, can ever after change the Nature of the Action, or the
Obligations resulting from it.</p>
<p class="pns">A<span class="sc">nd</span>, when we consider, on
the other hand, that Sin is committed by a frail finite Being,
very often in its unguarded Moments, prompted by Passion and
Appetite, and surrounded with the most powerful Temptations; this
proves more strongly, that it cannot be infinite. By the
<i>Justice</i> of G<span class="sc">od</span>, is not meant, that
he cannot forgive Sin without Satisfaction, but that he
<i>will</i> not punish the Innocent; He proposes himself as a
Pattern for our Imitation, and bids us <i>forgive our offending
Brethren, if they repent and desire Forgiveness:</i> and he
himself will therefore forgive on the same Terms; for unless Sin
becomes so enormous, as to make Punishment necessary,
<i>Repentance</i> and <i>Amendment</i> is all that G<span class=
"sc">od</span> expects. The Gospel is proposed to Sinners, on
these Terms; and as to the Death of C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span>, it were unreasonable to think, he laid
down his Life by way of Satisfaction to Offended Justice, in the
Manner these Gentlemen understand it; but in Testimony of the
Truth of his Doctrines, and Confirmation of G<span class=
"sc">od’s</span> <i>great Love</i> to the World. This was the
Cause of C<span class="sc">hrist’s</span> Coming in the Flesh.
G<span class="sc">od</span> so loved the World, that he sent
C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span> to save it, by such Preaching
and Miracles, and other internal Aids, &amp;<i>c</i>. as were in
themselves sufficient to beget Faith in such as gave a proper
Attention; such a Faith, in the Soul, as was productive of
Morality and Virtue in Practice. It was an <i>original Act</i> of
Grace and Goodness in G<span class="sc">od</span>, to send
C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span> into the World, to save
Sinners, and not (as some superstitiously teach) a mere
Compliance in G<span class="sc">od</span> the Father (and that,
not without full Satisfaction first made) to the <i>voluntary</i>
and <i>merciful</i> Intercession of C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> the Son. For then our Salvation would be
<i>owing only</i> to the Love of C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span>, and not <i>at all</i> to G<span class=
"sc">od</span>’s Love, who is here considered as a
<i>rigorous</i> and <i>unrelenting Creditor</i>, that will not
release the Debtor, until full Satisfaction be made; so that
C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span> becomes our Creditor, and
G<span class="sc">od</span> has no farther Demand: and what Need
then can there be of Intercession to G<span class="sc">od</span>
on our Behalf, when the Debt is already paid, and full
Satisfaction made? C<span class="sc">hrist’s</span> coming into
the World was <i>entirely owing</i> to the Father’s Mercy. His
Doctrine, Miracles, &amp;<i>c</i>. were what he had in Commission
from G<span class="sc">od</span>, as a Means to instruct and make
the World happy; it is he who, instead of being averse to forgive
frail Man his Offences, has through J<span class=
"sc ls2">esus</span> <i>proclaimed Pardon</i> to <i>all</i>, on
Condition of Repentance and Amendment; and thro’ the Love of
G<span class="sc">od</span> it was also, that C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> was appointed a Mediator for sinful Man: So
that the whole Affair arose from G<span class="sc">od’s</span>
own Mercy.</p>
<p class="pns">I <span class="sc">stand</span> amazed at the
Gentlemen, against whom I am arguing; what a <i>Scope</i> do they
give to the <i>Sovereignty</i> of G<span class="sc">od</span>, in
the Doctrines of <i>Election</i> and <i>Reprobation?</i> And yet
they won’t <i>suffer it</i> at all to operate, in the Case of
<i>forgiving Sin</i>, on the Terms of Repentance and Amendment. A
small, yea <i>very small</i> and reasonable Allowance, in regard
to the <i>Exertion</i> of this Attribute, and in a <i>good
Cause</i> too, would be sufficient to justify the Mercy of
G<span class="sc">od</span>, in forgiving Sin. If, as a
Sovereign, he punishes where no Sin is, surely he may also, as a
Sovereign, forgive Sin. So that this Notion of the Impossibility
of G<span class="sc">od</span>’s forgiving Sin, without
Satisfaction first made, is erroneous and despicable. Repentance
and Amendment in the Creature is, in the Nature of Things, a
<i>much better</i> Satisfaction, than can be made by the Act of
another. By the <i>Justice</i> of G<span class="sc">od</span>, I
repeat it again, is meant, that he will not punish the innocent,
and not that he cannot shew Mercy to an offending, repenting,
penitent Creature, unless another sheds his Blood for an
Atonement. Nor is the Righteousness of C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span>, <i>strictly speaking</i>, imputable to any
one. The Terms of the Gospel are, <i>Repent, and be converted,
and your Sins shall be blotted out:</i> Be <i>sorry</i> and
<i>amend</i>, and I will <i>forgive</i> you. <i>The Prayer of a
Righteous Man availeth much;</i> and G<span class="sc">od</span>,
in some Cases, to shew his Regard to the Righteous, and to excite
others to become righteous also, may possibly grant <i>that</i>,
at the Request of such a righteous Person, which without, it
might be improper to grant; and C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> being our holy and righteous Mediator,
G<span class="sc">od</span> may do more at his Request, on our
Behalf, than he would do without it. Not but that (<i>independent
of</i> and previous to the Intercession of C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span>, at least to the Account we have of it, in
the New Testament) G<span class="sc">od</span> was <i>ever
disposed</i> to be favourable to Man, and always ready to receive
him, coming to him in a proper and becoming Manner: For even this
very C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span>, and his Intercession,
&amp;<i>c</i>. is all ultimately the Act of G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, and flows from his unbounded Love and Goodness to
Man. So that <i>imputed Righteousness</i> can mean no more, than
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> forgiving us, at the Request of
J<span class="sc ls2">esus</span> C<span class=
"sc ls2">hrist</span> (whom he sent on purpose to make that
Request, and to do every thing for the Benefit and Happiness of
Man) and not a <i>real Transfer</i> of C<span class=
"sc">hrist’s</span> <i>personal</i> Righteousness, which is not
only in itself impossible, but would, if true, take away all
Necessity of our becoming holy. The Righteousness of
C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span> is altogether different to
what these Men take it to be; it is a real State of
Righteousness, wrought in the Soul by the Operation of
C<span class="sc ls2">hrist</span>’s <i>Spirit</i>, Man
submitting thereto. I know there are some Expressions in the
<i>New Testament</i>, which (if precipitantly understood, without
Regard had to the Nature of the Thing, and to other plain Texts)
seem <i>a little</i> to favour these Doctrines. I can’t say, by
what Means <i>precisely</i> the <i>Bible</i> came into its
present Condition; many Things might concur to give us wrong
Apprehensions of its true Sense and Meaning, He that understands
human Nature will find, that Men, who have been <i>great
Bigots</i> in any Way of Religion, <i>will generally retain</i>
some of their former Prejudices, even after, in the main, they
may have changed their Principles, Prejudice in Education is a
Leaven, not so easily purged out, as some may imagine; and ’tis
possible, the <i>Writings</i> of St. <i>Paul</i> may have in them
a Tincture of this kind; besides what may have since crept in, by
Partiality or Accident: against which, and <i>all Errors</i> of a
like Kind, a due Regard to the <i>fundamental Principles</i>, I
have endeavoured to inculcate, will, I hope, abundantly secure
us. These are some succinct Observations, that I could not well
avoid making; which perhaps may shortly be followed by something
more <i>full</i> and <i>comprehensive</i>, concerning the
<i>Virtue</i> and <i>Extent</i> of C<span class=
"sc">hrist’s</span> <i>Death</i>, and the Nature of <i>imputed
Righteousness</i>. What I have here delivered, concerning
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> <i>Sovereignty</i>, is not the
Result of a few, hasty, or loose Thoughts, but the Effect of long
and mature Deliberation. I have weighed over and over the
Arguments in my own Breast, and tried their Strength with People,
the most likely to afford me Satisfaction; and could I have found
it in either Way, the World had never been troubled with these
<i>Free and Impartial Thoughts</i>.</p>
<p class="pns">P<span class="sc">ermit</span> me, before I make
an End, just to observe, in Regard to the Controversy, between
Mr. <i>J—s</i> and Mr. <i>Taylor</i>, on the Scripture Doctrine
of <i>Original Sin;</i> that Mr. <i>J—s</i>, as well as Dr.
<i>W—s</i>, lays great Stress on that frivolous Distinction,
mentioned a few Pages back, of <i>moral</i> and <i>natural</i>
Necessity, to that Degree, that Mr. <i>Taylor</i> is treated
somewhat <i>rudely</i>, for not perceiving the Force of it; when
I dare aver, <i>none</i> but misguided Zealots, could ever see
any Reason or Argument in it: Nor do some of these very Men, who
urge it, seem to believe it themselves. Ask them how Man can be
justly accountable for Evils, that proceed from a <i>Nature
depraved in</i> Adam, and they immediately leave <i>this
Distinction</i>, and recur to the <i>Covenant;</i> and this
Covenant they cannot support by any Argument short of
G<span class="sc">od’s</span> <i>Sovereignty</i>, which they are
welcome (if they can tell how) to improve to their own
Advantage.</p>
<p class="pns">To say that Man, in the Fall, has natural Powers
to act rightly, and is therefore condemnable when he does not,
tho’, by Necessity; he wants Inclinations to be virtuous, would,
to <i>use</i> Mr. <i>J—s</i>’s genteel Language, <i>be a
senseless Falshood, and shew Poverty of Argument</i> (I am loth
to add as he does) <i>and Effrontery too</i>. Such Rudeness
deserves Lamentation as well as Reproof, nor do I on this
Occasion set before <i>him</i> his <i>own Words</i> with any
secret Pleasure, but purely to shew Mr. <i>J—s</i>, how agreeable
such a Liberty will appear, when, in return, it may be offered to
himself.</p>
<p class="pns">W<span class="sc">hy</span> is this favourite
Distinction urged, unless it be to shew, that because Man has
natural Powers, ’tis his <i>own</i> Fault, if he does not employ
them aright; but how does it appear, that such a Power
<i>only</i>, can render <i>Man</i> a whit better, or <i>more</i>
a <i>moral Agent</i>, than he is, or would be, without it? If
Inclination to <i>Virtue</i>, must <i>precede</i> every truly
virtuous Action; and Man’s Depravity under the Fall, be
<i>such</i> as prevents his ever having such good Inclinations,
his natural Ability to do Good, must needs be a mere <i>Joke</i>
and a <i>Cypher</i>. Just the same as, on the other hand, would
be, the strongest Inclinations to Virtue, and <i>no</i> natural
Power of complying with them in Practice. As nothing short of
<i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Power</i>, Power of both kinds,
<i>natural</i> and <i>moral</i>, can constitute Man a <i>moral
Agent</i>, or proper Subject of <i>Law</i>, of Rewards and
Punishments, either here, or hereafter; one would wonder to see
this insignificant Distinction urged at all in this Controversy:
for it is, at the best, a mere <i>Parade of Words;</i> which
prove nothing, except it be the Want of Truth and Righteousness,
in this Doctrine of <i>Original Sin;</i> or great <i>Bigotry</i>,
and Defect of Understanding, in its most accomplished Patrons.
And after all that is, or can be said, concerning <i>natural</i>
and <i>moral</i> Powers; it is doubtful, if such a depraved
miserable Wretch, as Man under the Fall is said by the
<i>Assemblies Catechism</i> to be, can (strictly speaking) have
any Power at all over his own Thoughts and Actions; The immediate
Cause and Spring of Action <i>is</i> the <i>Soul</i>, to which
the <i>Body</i> is subservient only as an <i>Instrument</i>, but
has in itself, according to the best Philosophy, no Power to
produce <i>voluntary</i> or <i>self Motion</i>. What is called
<i>natural</i> Power in Man, as opposed to <i>moral</i>, is at
least, a Power lodged in the Soul, to give Motion to the Body.
But these <i>Volitions</i> of the Mind, and the immediate Act of
the Soul upon the Body, in order to produce <i>Virtue</i>,
depending on the Mind’s being in a State of <i>Freedom</i>, able
to chuse and prefer Virtue, as better than Vice; it is evident,
that in a Mind, totally abandoned to Evil, <i>moral</i> Motives
have not their due Power over the Man; and what we call his
<i>natural</i> Power to be virtuous, is either suspended, or
quite overpowered, by an evil and irresistable Turn of
Inclination, arising from the <i>Act</i> of another; I mean,
<i>Adam</i>. Man then, considered as a <i>moral</i> Agent, has
Power to <i>do</i>, or <i>not</i> to <i>do</i>, the very same
Thing; be it good or evil. But this Liberty of Choice and Action
in the Creature, as the <i>Soul</i> is but <span class=
"sc">one</span>, and also <i>the</i> immediate Source of all
Action in Man, cannot properly, I think, be called <i>two</i>
distinct Powers, but rather <i>different Applications</i> of
<i>one</i> and the <i>same Power</i> lodged in the Soul. On the
other hand, in such a <i>depraved Creature</i>, as Man under the
Fall is said to be, the Power of <i>choosing</i> and
<i>refusing</i>, of being virtuous or vicious, which he
<i>pleases</i>, is altogether lost and destroyed; and such a Man,
so far from having <i>natural</i> and <i>moral</i> Powers, has
(properly speaking) <i>no Power</i> at all remaining: all his
Thoughts and Actions, like those of a Machine, are merely
involuntary; he is constantly impelled by something mightier than
himself, and ever necessitated to think and act as he does: his
being an intelligent Creature, doth not alter the State of the
Case, or render him more an Agent than a Stock or a Stone. In
this sad Condition, Man can have no Power at all to love and
pursue Virtue, untill the overruling Principle, which determines
all his Thoughts and Actions to the contrary, be removed, or he
receive Superaddition of Understanding and Strength agreeable
thereto. My natural Strength of Body may be equal to four hundred
Weight; but what can this avail, while I am continually pressed
down by four thousand? and all Mr. <i>J—s</i>’s Skill and
Criticism (<i>Pages</i> 71, 72) will not evade this Reasoning.
The Distinction between immediate and remote Causes of Sin, is as
trifling and inconclusive, as the ’forementioned Distinction of
<i>moral</i> and <i>natural</i> Powers. Those indeed, who can
fancy themselves to be G<span class="sc">od’s</span> own dear and
elect Children, may reject all Opposition with <i>Scorn</i>, and
without <i>Examination</i>, and acquiesce readily in the most
rigid and tyrannical System of Religion, that renders the Bulk of
Mankind miserable, while the Elect may think themselves secure in
the Divine Decree, <i>with an humble Assent, and awful</i> (it
should be superstitious) <i>Reverence of the Majesty and
Sovereignty of the great God</i>. But what Reason or Recompence
will that be to <i>him</i>, who under proper Means and Motives
would have kept the Commandments, and so have entered into Life;
who would have loved the L<span class="sc ls2">ord</span> his
G<span class="sc">od</span>, with all his Heart, Soul, and
Strength; and his Neighbour as himself? Or how can such a partial
and tyrannical Doctrine, be reconciled to the Voice of Reason in
Man, to our common Notions of <i>Right</i> and <i>Wrong</i>, to
the General Scope and Tenour of the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>, or to
that Text in particular, which assures us, that <i>the Almighty
doth not grieve nor afflict the Children of Men
willingly?</i></p>
